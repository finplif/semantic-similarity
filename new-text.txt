the gambler by fyodor dostoyevsky translate by hogarth i at length i return from two week leave of absence to find that my patron have arrive three day ago in roulettenberg
i receive from them a welcome quite different to that which i have expect
the general eyed me coldly greet me in rather haughty fashion and dismiss me to pay my respect to his sister
it be clear that from money have be acquire
i think i could even detect a certain shamefacedness in the general s glance
maria philipovna too seemed distraught and converse with me with an air of detachment
nevertheless she take the money which i hand to her count it and listen to what i have to tell
to luncheon there be expect that day a monsieur mezentsov a french lady and an englishman for whenever money be in hand a banquet in muscovite style be always give
polina alexandrovna on see me inquired why i have be so long away
then without wait for an answer she depart
evidently this be not mere accident and i felt that i must throw some light upon matter
it be high time that i do so
i be assign a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel for you must know that i belong to the general s suite
so far as i could see the party have already gain some notoriety in the place which have come to look upon the general as a russian nobleman of great wealth
indeed even before luncheon he charge me among other thing to get two note change for him at the hotel counter which put us in a position to be think millionaire at all event for a week
later i be about to take mischa and nadia for a walk when a summons reach me from the staircase that i must attend the general
he begin by deign to inquire of me where i be go to take the child and as he do so i could see that he fail to look me in the eye
he to do so but each time be meet by me with such a fixed disrespectful stare that he desist in confusion
in pompous language however which jumble one sentence into another and at length grow disconnect he give me to understand that i be to lead the child altogether away from the casino and out into the park
finally his anger explode and he add sharply i suppose you would like to take them to the casino to play roulette
well excuse my speaking so plainly but i know how addict you be to gamble
though i be not your mentor nor wish to be at least i have a right to require that you shall not actually i have no money for gamble i quietly reply
but you will soon be in receipt of some retort the general redden a little as he dive into his write desk and apply himself to a memorandum book
from it he saw that he have rouble of mine in his keep
let us calculate he go on
we must translate these rouble into thalers
thalers as a round sum
the rest will be safe in my in silence i take the money
you must not be offend at what i say he continue
you be too touchy about these thing
what i have say i have say merely as a warning
to do so be no more than my when return home with the child before luncheon i meet a cavalcade of our party rid to view some ruin
two splendid carriage magnificently horse with mlle
blanche maria philipovna and polina alexandrovna in one of them and the frenchman the englishman and the general in attendance on horseback
the stopped to stare at them for the effect be general could not have improve upon it
i calculate that with the franc which i have bring with me add to what my patron seem already to have acquire the party must be in possession of at least or that would be none too much for mlle
blanche who with her mother and the frenchman be also lodge in our hotel
the latter gentleman be call by the lacqueys monsieur le comte and mlle
blanche s mother be dub madame la perhaps in very truth they comte et i know that monsieur le comte would take no notice of me when we meet at dinner as also that the general would not dream of introduce us nor of recommend me to the however the latter have live awhile in russia and know that the person refer to as an uchitel be never look upon as a bird of fine feather
of course strictly speak he me but i be an uninvited guest at the general have forget to arrange otherwise or i should have be dispatch to dine at the table d hôte
nevertheless i present myself in such guise that the general look at me with a touch of approval and though the good maria philipovna be for show me my place the fact of my have previously meet the englishman astley save me and thenceforward i figure as one of the company
this strange englishman i have meet first in prussia where we have happen to sit in a railway train in which i be travel to overtake our party while late i have run across him in france and again in within the space of two week
to think therefore that i should suddenly encounter him again here in roulettenberg
never in my life have i know a more retiring man for he be shy to the pitch of imbecility yet well aware of the fact for he be no fool
at the same time he be a gentle amiable sort of an individual and even on our first encounter in prussia i have contrive to draw him out and he have tell me that he have just be to the north cape and be now anxious to visit the fair at nizhni novgorod
how he have come to make the general s acquaintance i do not know but apparently he be much struck with polina
also he be delighted that i should sit next him at table for he appear to look upon me as his bosom friend
during the meal the frenchman be in great feather he be discursive and pompous to every one
in moscow too i remember he have blow a great many bubble
interminably he discourse on finance and russian politics and though at time the general make feint to contradict him he do so humbly and as though wish not wholly to lose sight of his own dignity
for myself i be in a curious frame of mind
even before luncheon be half finished i have ask myself the old eternal question do i continue to dance attendance upon the general instead of have leave him and his family long ago every now and then i would glance at polina alexandrovna but she pay me no attention until eventually i become so irritated that i decide to play the boor
first of all i suddenly and for no reason whatever plunge loudly and gratuitously into the general conversation
above everything i want to pick a quarrel with the frenchman and with that end in view i turn to the general and exclaim in an overbear sort of i think that i actually interrupt that summer it have be almost impossible for a russian to dine anywhere at table d hôte
the general bent upon me a glance of astonishment
if one be a man of i go on one risk abuse by so do and be force to put up with insult of every kind
both at paris and on the rhine and even in be so many pole with their sympathiser the french at these table d hôte that one can not get a word in edgeways if one happen only to be a this i say in french
the general eyed me doubtfully for he do not know whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that i should so far forget myself
of course one always learn say the frenchman in a careless contemptuous sort of tone
in paris too i have a dispute with a pole i continue and then with a french officer who support him
after that a section of the frenchmen present take my part
they do so as soon as i tell them the story of how once i threaten to spit into monsignor s to spit into it the general inquire with grave disapproval in his tone and a stare of astonishment while the frenchman look at me unbelievingly
just so i reply
you must know that on one occasion when for two day i have felt certain that at any moment i might have to depart for rome on business i repair to the embassy of the holy see in paris to have my passport visaed
there i encounter a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien
after listen politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan ask me to wait a little
i be in a great hurry to depart but of course i sit down pull out a copy of opinion and fell to read an extraordinary piece of invective against russia which it happen to contain
as i be thus engage i hear some one enter an adjoining room and ask for monsignor after which i saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor take his leave
i venture to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increase dryness he again ask me to wait
soon a third visitor arrive who like myself have come on business he be an austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he have state his errand he be conduct upstairs
this make me very angry
i rise approach the sacristan and tell him that since monsignor be receive caller his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well
upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment
it simply pass his understanding that any insignificant russian should dare to compare himself with other visitor of monsignor s
in a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he be delight to have a chance of insult me he look me up and down and then say do you suppose that monsignor be go to put aside his coffee for but i only cry the louder let me tell you that i be go to into that coffee
yes and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very minute i shall take it to monsignor what
while he be engage with a cardinal screech the sacristan again shrink back in horror
then rush to the door he spread out his arm as though he would rather die than let me enter
thereupon i declare that i be a heretic and a je suis hérétique et barbare i say and that these archbishop and cardinal and monsignor and the rest of them mean nothing at all to me
in a word i show him that i be not go to give way
he look at me with an air of infinite resentment
then he snatch up my passport and depart with it upstairs
a minute later the passport have be visaed
here it be now if you care to see it i pull out the document and exhibit the roman visa
the general begin
what really save you be the fact that you proclaim yourself a heretic and a barbarian remark the frenchman with a smile
cela n était pa si but be how russian subject ought to be treat
why when they settle here they dare not utter even a be ready even to deny the fact that they be russian
at all event at my hotel in paris i receive far more attention from the company after i have tell them about the fracas with the sacristan
a fat polish nobleman who have be the most offensive of all who be present at the table d hôte at once go upstairs while some of the frenchman be simply disgust when i tell them that two year ago i have encounter a man at whom in a french hero fire for the mere fun of discharge his musket
that man be then a boy of ten and his family be still reside in impossible the frenchman splutter
no french soldier would fire at a child nevertheless the incident be as i say i reply
a very respected tell me the story and i myself could see the scar leave on his the frenchman then begin chatter volubly and the general support him but i recommend the former to read for example extract from the memoir of general perovski who in be a prisoner in the hand of the french
finally maria philipovna say something to interrupt the conversation
the general be furious with me for have start the altercation with the frenchman
on the other hand astley seem to take great pleasure in my brush with monsieur and rise from the table propose that we should go and have a drink together
the same afternoon at four o clock i go to have my customary talk with polina alexandrovna and the talk soon extend to a stroll
we enter the park and approach the casino where polina seat herself upon a bench near the fountain and send nadia away to a little distance to play with some other child
mischa also i dispatch to play by the fountain and in this fashion be to say polina and to find ourselves alone
of course we begin by talk on business matter
polina seem furious when i hand her only gülden for she have think to receive from paris as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamond at least gülden or even more
come what may i have money she say
and get it somehow i i shall be i ask her what have happen during my absence
nothing except that two piece of news have reach us from petersburg
in the first place my grandmother be very ill and unlikely to last another couple of day
we have this from timothy petrovitch himself and he be a reliable person
every moment we be expect to receive news of the all of you be on the tiptoe of expectation i query
of of us and every minute of the day
for a now we have be look for look for it yes look for it
i be not her blood relation you be merely the general s
yet i be certain that the old lady have remember me in her yes i believe that you come in for a good deal i say with some assurance
yes for she be fond of me
but how come you to think so i answer this question with another one
that marquis of yours i say also familiar with your family secret and why be you yourself so interested in them be her retort as she eye me with dry grimness
never mind
if i be not mistake the general have succeed in borrow money of the it may be be it likely that the marquis would have lend the money if he have not know something or other about your grandmother
do you notice too that three time during luncheon when speaking of her he call her la baboulenka
what love friendly behaviour to be sure dear little grandmother
yes that be true
as soon as ever he learn that i be likely to inherit something from her he begin to pay me his address
i think you ought to know then he have only just begin his courting
why i think he have be do so a long while you he have not retort polina angrily
but where on earth do you pick up this englishman she say this after a pause
i you would ask about him whereupon i tell her of my previous encounter with astley while travel
he be very shy i say and susceptible
also he be in love with yes he in love with me she reply
and he be ten time richer than the frenchman
in fact what do the frenchman posse
to me it seem at least doubtful that he possess anything at oh no there be no doubt about it
he do possess some château or other
last night the general tell me that for certain
be you satisfied nevertheless in your place i should marry the and why ask polina
because though the frenchman be the handsomer of the two he be also the baser whereas the englishman be not only a man of honour but ten time the wealthier of the yes
but then the frenchman be a marquis and the cleverer of the two remark polina imperturbably
be that so i repeat
yes polina be not at all please at my question i could see that she be do her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answer
but i take no notice of this
it amuse me to see you grow angry she continue
however inasmuch as i allow you to indulge in these question and conjecture you ought to pay me something for the i consider that i have a perfect right to put these question to you be my calm retort for the reason that i be ready to pay for them and also care little what become of polina giggle
last time you tell on the at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand foot into the abyss
some day i may remind you of that say in order to see if you will be as good as your word
yes you may depend upon it that i shall do so
i hate you because i have allow you to go to such length and i also hate you and still you be so necessary to me
for the time be i want you so i must keep then she make a movement to rise
her tone have sound very angry
indeed of late her talk with me have invariably end on a note of temper and of real temper
may i ask you who be this mlle
blanche i inquire since i do not wish polina to depart without an explanation
you who she mlle
blanche
nothing further have transpire
probably she will soon be madame be to say if the rumour that grandmamma be near her end should prove true
mlle
blanche with her mother and her cousin the marquis know very well that as thing now stand we be and be the general at last in love that have nothing to do with it
listen to me
take these florin and go and play roulette with them
win as much for me as you can for i be badly in need of so say she call nadia back to her side and enter the casino where she join the rest of our party
for myself i take in muse astonishment the first path to the left
something have seem to strike my brain when she tell me to go and play roulette
strangely enough that something have also seem to make me hesitate and to set me analyse my feeling with regard to her
in fact during the two week of my absence i have felt far more at my ease than i do now on the day of my return although while travel i have mop like an imbecile rush about like a man in a fever and actually behold her in my dream
indeed on one occasion this happen in switzerland when i be asleep in the train i have speak aloud to her and set all my laughing
again therefore i put to myself the question do i or do i not love her and again i could return myself no answer or rather for the hundredth time i tell myself that i detest her
yes i detest her there be moment more especially at the close of our talk together when i would gladly have give half my life to have strangle her
i swear that have there at such moment be a sharp knife ready to my hand i would have seize that knife with pleasure and plunge it into her breast
yet i also swear that if on the shlangenberg she have say to me leap into that abyss i should have leap into it and with equal pleasure
yes this i know well
one way or the other the thing must soon be end
she too know it in some curious way the thought that i be fully conscious of her inaccessibility and of the impossibility of my ever realise my dream afford her i be certain the keen possible pleasure
otherwise be it likely that she the cautious and clever woman that she be would have indulge in this familiarity and openness with me
hitherto i conclude she have look upon me in the same light that the old empress do upon her empress who hesitate not to unrobe herself before her slave since she do not account a slave a man
yes often polina must have take me for something less than a man still she have charge me with a win what i could at roulette
yet all the time i could not help wonder it be so necessary for her to win something and what new scheme could have spring to birth in her brain
a host of new and unknown factor seem to have arise during the last two week
well it behove me to divine them and to probe them and that as soon as possible
yet not now at the present moment i must repair to the
ii i confess i do not like it
although i have make up my mind to play i felt averse to do so on behalf of some one else
in fact it almost upset my balance and i enter the gaming room with an angry feeling at my heart
at first glance the scene irritate me
never at any time have i be able to bear the flunkeyishness which one meet in the press of the world at large but more especially in that of russia where almost every evening journalists write on two subject in on the splendour and luxury of the casino to be find in the rhenish town and on the heap of gold which be daily to be see lie on their table
those journalist be not pay for do so they write thus merely out of a spirit of disinterested complaisance
for there be nothing splendid about the establishment in question and not only be there no heap of gold to be see lie on their table but also there be very little money to be see at all
of course during the season madman or another may make his an englishman or an asiatic or a as had happen during the summer of which i write win or lose a great deal but as regard the rest of the crowd it play only for petty gülden and seldom do much wealth figure on the board
when on the present occasion i enter the for the first time in my life it be several moment before i could even make up my mind to play
for one thing the crowd oppress me
have i be play for myself i think i should have leave at once and never have embark upon gamble at all for i could feel my heart begin to beat and my heart be anything but
also i know i have long ago make up my mind that never should i depart from roulettenberg until some radical some final change have take place in my fortune
thus it must and would be
however ridiculous it may seem to you that i be expect to win at roulette i look upon the generally accept opinion concern the folly and the grossness of hop to win at gamble as a thing even more absurd
for why be gamble a whit bad than any other method of acquire money
how for instance be it bad than trade
true out of a hundred person only one can win yet what business be that of yours or of mine
at all event i confine myself at first simply to look on and decide to attempt nothing serious
indeed i felt that if i begin to do anything at all i should do it in an haphazard sort of that i felt certain
also it behove me to learn the game itself since despite a thousand description of roulette which i have read with ceaseless avidity i know nothing of its rule and have never even see it play
in the first place everything about it seem to me so morally mean and foul
yet i be not speak of the hungry restless folk who by score nay even by be see crowd around the
for in a desire to win quickly and to win much i can see nothing sordid i have always applaud the opinion of a certain dead and go but cocksure moralist who reply to the excuse that one may always gamble moderately by say that to do so make thing bad since in that case the profit too will always be moderate
insignificant profit and sumptuous profit do not stand on the same footing
no it be all a matter of proportion
what may seem a small sum to a rothschild may seem a large sum to me and it be not the fault of stake or of winning that everywhere men can be find win can be find deprive their fellow of something just as they do at roulette
as to the question whether stake and winning be in themselves immoral be another question altogether and i wish to express no opinion upon it
yet the very fact that i be full of a strong desire to win cause this gambling for gain in spite of its attendant squalor to contain if you will something intimate something sympathetic to my eye for it be always pleasant to see men dispense with ceremony and act naturally and in an unbuttoned mood
yet why should i so deceive myself
i could see that the whole thing be a vain and unreasoning pursuit and what at the first glance seem to me the ugly feature in this mob of roulette player be their respect for their seriousness and even the humility with which they stand around the gaming table
moreover i have always draw sharp distinction between a game which be mauvais and a game which be permissible to a decent man
in fact there be two sort of the game of the gentleman and the game of the game for gain and the game of the herd
herein as say i draw sharp distinction
yet how essentially base be the distinction
for instance a gentleman may stake say five or ten louis d more unless he be a very rich man when he may stake say a thousand franc but he must do this simply for the love of the game for sport simply in order to observe the process of win or of lose and above all thing as a man who remain quite uninterested in the possibility of his issue a winner
if he win he will be at liberty perhaps to give vent to a laugh or to pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander or to stake again or to double his stake but even this he must do solely out of curiosity and for the pleasure of watch the play of chance and of calculation and not because of any vulgar desire to win
in a word he must look upon the upon roulette and upon trente et quarante as mere relaxation which have be arrange solely for his amusement
of the existence of the lure and gain upon which the bank be found and maintain he must profess to have not an inkling
best of all he ought to imagine his and the rest of the mob which stand tremble over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly with himself and play solely for recreation and pleasure
this complete ignorance of the reality this innocent view of mankind be what in my opinion constitute the truly aristocratic
for instance i have see even fond mother so far indulge their guileless elegant of fifteen or to give them a few gold coin and teach them how to play and though the young lady may have win or have lose they have invariably laugh and depart as though they be well pleased
in the same way i saw our general once approach the table in a stolid important manner
a lacquey dart to offer him a chair but the general do not even notice him
slowly he take out his money bag and slowly extracted franc in gold which he stake on the black and win
yet he do not take up his leave them there on the table
again the black turn up and again he do not gather in what he have win and when in the third round the turn up he lose at a stroke franc
yet even then he rise with a smile and thus preserve his reputation yet i know that his money bag must be chafe his heart as well as that have the stake be twice or thrice as much again he would still have restrain himself from vent his disappointment
on the other hand i saw a frenchman first win and then lose franc cheerfully and without a murmur
yes even if a gentleman should lose his whole substance he must never give way to annoyance
money must be so subservient to gentility as never to be worth a thought
of course the aristocratic thing be to be entirely oblivious of the mire of rabble with its setting but sometimes a reverse course may be aristocratic to remark to scan and even to gape at the mob for preference through a lorgnette even as though one be take the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree show which have be organise specially for a gentleman s diversion
though one may be squeeze by the crowd one must look as though one be fully assure of be the have neither part nor lot with the observed
at the same time to stare fixedly about one be unbecoming for that again be ungentlemanly see that no spectacle be worth an open no spectacle in the world which merit from a gentleman too pronounce an inspection
however to me personally the scene seem to be worth undisguised especially in view of the fact that i have come there not only to look at but also to number myself sincerely and wholeheartedly with the mob
as for my secret moral view i have no room for them amongst my actual practical opinion
let that stand as write i be write only to relieve my conscience
yet let me say also this that from the first i have be consistent in have an intense aversion to any trial of my act and thought by a moral standard
another standard altogether have direct my life as a matter of fact the mob be play in exceedingly foul fashion
indeed i have an idea that sheer robbery be go on around that
the croupier who sit at the two end of it have not only to watch the stake but also to calculate the immense amount of work for two men
as for the crowd it consist mostly of frenchman
yet i be not then take note merely in order to be able to give you a description of roulette but in order to get my bearing as to my behaviour when i myself should begin to play
for example i notice that nothing be more common than for another s hand to stretch out and grab one s winning whenever one have win
then there would arise a dispute and frequently an uproar and it would be a case of i beg of you to prove and to produce witness to the fact that the stake be at first the proceeding be pure greek to me
i could only divine and distinguish that stake be hazard on number on odd or even and on colour
polina s money i decide to risk that even only to the amount of gülden
the thought that i be not go to play for myself quite unnerve me
it be an unpleasant sensation and i try hard to banish it
i have a feeling that once i have begin to play for polina i should wreck my own fortune
also i wonder if any one have approach a without fall an immediate prey to superstition
i begin by pull out fifty gülden and stake them on the wheel spun and stop at
i have lose
with a feeling like a sick qualm as though i would like to make my way out of the crowd and go home i stake another fifty time on the red
the red turn up
next time i stake the gülden just where they again the red turn up
again i stake the whole sum and again the red turn up
clutch my gülden i place of them on twelve figure to see what would come of it
the result be that the croupier pay me out three time my total stake
thus from gülden my store have grow to
upon that such a curious such an inexplicable unwonted feeling overcame me that i decide to depart
always the thought keep recur to me that if i have be play for myself alone i should never have have such luck
once more i stake the whole gülden on the the wheel stop at
i be pay out another gülden and snatch up my pile of depart in search of polina alexandrovna
i find the whole party walking in the park and be able to get an interview with her only after supper
this time the frenchman be absent from the meal and the general seem to be in a more expansive vein
among other thing he think it necessary to remind me that he would be sorry to see me play at the
in his opinion such conduct would greatly compromise if i be to lose much
and even if you be to much i should be compromise he add in a meaning sort of way
of course i have no to order your action but you yourself will agree that as usual he do not finish his sentence
i answer drily that i have very little money in my possession and that consequently i be hardly in a position to indulge in any conspicuous play even if i do gamble
at last when ascend to my own room i succeed in hand polina her winning and tell her that next time i should not play for her
why not she ask excitedly
because i wish to play i reply with a feigned glance of astonishment
that be my sole then be you so certain that your will get us out of our difficulty she inquire with a quizzical smile
i say very seriously yes and then add possibly my certainty about win may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in nonetheless she insist that i ought to go half with her in the day s winning and offer me gülden on condition that henceforth i gamble only on those term but i refuse to do so once and for as my reason that i find myself unable to play on behalf of any one else i be not unwilling so to do i add but in all probability i should well absurd though it be i place great hope on your playing of roulette she remark musingly wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal share wherefore of course you will do as i then she leave me without listen to any further protest on my part
iii on the morrow she say not a word to me about gamble
in fact she purposely avoid me although her old manner to me have not change the same serene coolness be hers on meeting coolness that be mingle even with a spice of contempt and dislike
in short she be at no pain to conceal her aversion to me
that i could see plainly
also she do not trouble to conceal from me the fact that i be necessary to her and that she be keep me for some end which she have in view
consequently there become establish between us relation which to a large extent be incomprehensible to me consider her general pride and aloofness
for example although she know that i be madly in love with her she allow me to speak to her of my passion though she could not well have show her contempt for me more than by permit me unhindered and unrebuked to mention to her my love
you see her attitude express how little i regard your feeling as well as how little i care for what you say to me or for what you feel for likewise though she speak as before concern her affair it be never with complete frankness
in her contempt for me there be refinement
although she know well that i be aware of a certain circumstance in her life of something which might one day cause her trouble she would speak to me about her affair whenever she have need of me for a give end as though i be a slave or a passing tell them me only in so far as one would need to know them if one be go to be make temporary use of
have i not know the whole chain of event or have she not see how much i be pain and disturb by her teasing insistency she would never have think it worthwhile to soothe me with this though since she not infrequently use me to execute commission that be not only troublesome but risky she ought in my opinion to have be frank in case
but forsooth it be not worth her while to trouble about the fact that be uneasy and perhaps thrice as put about by her care and misfortune as she be herself
for three week i have know of her intention to take to roulette
she have even warn me that she would like me to play on her behalf since it be unbecoming for her to play in person and from the tone of her word i have gather that there be something on her mind besides a mere desire to win money
as if money could matter to no she have some end in view and there be circumstance at which i could guess but which i do not know for certain
true the slavery and abasement in which she hold me might have give me such thing often do so the power to question her with abrupt directness see that inasmuch as i figure in her eye as a mere slave and nonentity she could not very well have take offence at any rude curiosity but the fact be that though she let me question her she never return me a single answer and at time do not so much as notice me
that be how matter stand
next day there be a good deal of talk about a telegram which four day ago have be send to petersburg but to which there have come no answer
the general be visibly disturbed and moody for the matter concern his mother
the frenchman too be excite and after dinner the whole party talk long and seriously frenchman s tone be extraordinarily presumptuous and offhand to everybody
it almost remind one of the proverb invite a man to your table and soon he will place his foot upon even to polina he be brusque almost to the point of rudeness
yet still he seem glad to join us in our walk in the casino or in our ride and drive about the town
i have long be aware of certain circumstance which bind the general to him i have long be aware that in russia they have hatch some scheme together although i do not know whether the plot have come to anything or whether it be still only in the stage of be talk of
likewise i be aware in part of a family that last year the frenchman have bail the general out of debt and give him roubles wherewith to pay his treasury due on retire from the service
and now of course the general be in a the chief part in the affair be be play by mlle
blanche
yes of this last i have no doubt
but be this mlle
blanche
it be say of her that she be a frenchwoman of good birth who live with her mother possess a colossal fortune
it be also say that she be some relation to the marquis but only a distant one a cousin or or something of the sort
likewise i know that up to the time of my journey to paris she and the frenchman have be more ceremonious towards our have stand on a much more precise and delicate footing with them but that now their friendship their take on a much more and air
perhaps they think that our mean be too modest for them and therefore unworthy of politeness or reticence
also for the last three day i have notice certain look which astley have keep throw at mlle
blanche and her mother and it have occur to me that he must have have some previous acquaintance with the pair
i have even surmise that the frenchman too must have meet astley before
astley be a man so shy reserve and taciturn in his manner that one might have look for anything from him
at all event the frenchman accord him only the slight of greeting and scarcely even look at him
certainly he do not seem to be afraid of him which be intelligible enough
but why do mlle
blanche also never look at the englishman since of something or another the marquis have declare the englishman to be immensely and indubitably rich
be not that a sufficient reason to make mlle
blanche look at the englishman
anyway the general seem extremely uneasy and one could well understand what a telegram to announce the death of his mother would mean for him
although i think it probable that polina be avoid me for a definite reason i adopt a cold and indifferent air for i felt pretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approach me
for two day therefore i devote my attention to mlle
blanche
the poor general be in despair
to fall in love at and with such vehemence be indeed a misfortune
and add to that his widowerhood his child his ruined property his debt and the woman with whom he have fall in love
though mlle
blanche be extremely i may or may not be understood when i say that she have one of those face which one be afraid of
at all event i myself have always fear such woman
apparently about year of age she be tall and with shoulder that slop yet though her neck and bosom be ample in their proportion her skin be dull yellow in colour while her hair which be extremely to make two coiffure be as black as indian ink
add to that a pair of black eye with yellowish white a proud glance gleam teeth and lip which be perennially pomade and redolent of musk
as for her dress it be invariably rich effective and chic yet in good taste
lastly her foot and hand be astonish and her voice a deep contralto
sometimes when she laugh she display her teeth but at ordinary time her air be taciturn and in the presence of polina and maria philipovna
yet she seem to me almost destitute of education and even of wit though cunning and suspicious
this apparently be not because her life have be lack in incident
perhaps if all be know the marquis be not her kinsman at all nor her mother her mother but there be evidence that in berlin where we have first come across the pair they have possess acquaintance of good standing
as for the marquis himself i doubt to this day if he be a about the fact that he have formerly belong to high society for instance in moscow and germany there could be no doubt whatever
what he have formerly be in france i have not a notion
all i knew be that he be say to possess a château
during the last two week i have look for much to transpire but be still ignorant whether at that time anything decisive ever pass between mademoiselle and the general
everything seem to depend upon our whether the general would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face
if ever the news should arrive that the grandmother be not dead mlle
blanche i felt sure would disappear in a twinkling
indeed it surprise and amuse me to observe what a passion for intrigue i be develop
but how i loathe it all
with what pleasure would i have give everybody and everything the
could not leave polina
how then could i show contempt for those who surround her
espionage be a base thing have i to do with that
astley too i find a curious person
i be only sure that he have fall in love with polina
a remarkable and divert circumstance be the amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man who have be touch with the divine when he would rather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or look
though astley frequently meet us when we be out walking he would merely take off his hat and pas us by though i know he be die to join us
even when invite to do so he would refuse
again in place of the casino at concert or near the be never far from the spot where we be sit
in fact we be in the park in the forest or on the need but to raise one s eye and glance around to catch sight of at least a of astley s frame stick on an adjacent path or behind a bush
yet never do he lose any chance of speak to myself and one morning when we have meet and exchange a couple of word he burst out in his usual abrupt way without say that mlle
blanche he say
well i have see a good many woman like after that he be silent as he look me meaningly in the face
what he mean i do not know but to my glance of inquiry he return only a dry nod and a reiterate it be presently however he resume do mlle
polina like flower i really can not say be my reply
what
you can not say he cry in great astonishment
no i have never notice whether she do so or not i repeat with a smile
hm
then i have an idea in my mind he conclude
lastly with a nod he walk away with a pleased expression on his face
the conversation have be carry on in execrable french
iv today have be a day of folly stupidity and ineptness
the time be now eleven o clock in the evening and i be sit in my room and thinking
it all begin this morning with my be force to go and play roulette for polina alexandrovna
when she hand me over her store of six hundred gülden i exact two that i should not go half with her in her winning if any that be to say i should not take anything for myself and that she should explain to me that same even why it be so necessary for her to win and how much be the sum which she need
for i could not suppose that she be do all this merely for the sake of money
yet clearly she need some money and that as soon as possible and for a special purpose
well she promise to explain matter and i depart
there be a tremendous crowd in the
what an arrogant greedy crowd it be
i press forward towards the middle of the room until i have secure a seat at a croupier s elbow
then i begin to play in timid fashion venture only twenty or thirty gülden at a time
meanwhile i observe and take note
it seem to me that calculation be superfluous and by no mean possess of the importance which certain other player attach to it even though they sit with ruled paper in their hand whereon they set down the coup calculate the chance reckon stake exactly as we more simple mortal do who play without any reckoning at all
however i deduce from the scene one conclusion which seem to me that in the flow of fortuitous chance there be if not a system at all event a sort of order
this of course be a very strange thing
for instance after a dozen middle figure there would always occur a dozen or so out one
suppose the ball stop twice at a dozen outer figure it would then pass to a dozen of the first one and then again to a dozen of the middle cipher and fall upon them three or four time and then revert to a dozen outers whence after another couple of round the ball would again pass to the first figure strike upon them once and then return thrice to the middle thus for an hour and a half or two hour
one three two one three two
it be all very curious
again for the whole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black but almost without any order and from moment to moment so that scarcely two consecutive round would end upon either the one or the other
yet next day or perhaps the next evening the red alone would turn up and attain a run of over two score and continue so for quite a length of for a whole day
of these circumstance the majority be point out to me by astley who stand by the the whole morning yet never once stake in person
for myself i lose all that i have on me and with great speed
to begin with i stake two hundred gülden on even and win
then i stake the same amount again and win and so on some two or three time
at one moment i must have have in my there within a space of five gülden
that of course be the proper moment for me to have depart but there arose in me a strange sensation as of a challenge to of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek and to put out my tongue at her
accordingly i set down the large stake allow by the lost
fire by this mishap i pull out all the money leave to me stake it all on the same venture lose
then i rise from the table feeling as though i be stupefy
what have happen to me i do not know but before luncheon i tell polina of my which time i walk about the park
at luncheon i be as excited as i have be at the meal three day ago
mlle
blanche and the frenchman be lunch with us and it appear that the former have be to the casino that morning and have see my exploit there
so now she show me more attention when talk to me while for his part the frenchman approach me and ask outright if it have be my own money that i have lose
he appear to be suspicious as to something be on foot between polina and myself but i merely fire up and reply that the money have be all my own
at this the general seem extremely surprised and ask me whence i have procure it whereupon i reply that though i have begin only with gülden six or seven round have increase my capital to or gülden and that subsequently i have lose the whole in two round
all this of course be plausible enough
during my recital i glance at polina but nothing be to be discern on her face
however she have allow me to fire up without correct me and from that i conclude that it be my to fire up and to conceal the fact that i have be play on her behalf
at all event i think to myself she in her turn have promise to give me an explanation and to reveal to me something or although the general appear to be take stock of me he say nothing
yet i could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face
perhaps his straitened circumstance make it hard for him to have to hear of pile of gold passing through the hand of an irresponsible fool like myself within the space of a quarter of an hour
now i have an idea that last night he and the frenchman have a sharp encounter with one another
at all event they closet themselves together and then have a long and vehement discussion after which the frenchman depart in what appear to be a passion but return early this morning to renew the combat
on hearing of my loss however he only remark with a sharp and even a malicious air that a man ought to go more next for some reason or another he add that though a great many russian go in for gamble they be no good at the think that roulette be devise specially for russian i retort and when the frenchman smile contemptuously at my reply i further remark that i be sure i be right also that speaking of russian in the capacity of gambler i have far more blame for them than that he could be quite sure
upon what do you base your opinion he inquire
upon the fact that to the virtue and merit of the civilised westerner there have become historically this be not his chief capacity for acquire capital whereas not only be the russian incapable of acquire capital but also he exhaust it wantonly and of sheer folly
none the less we russian often need money wherefore we be glad of and greatly devote to a method of acquisition like in a couple of hour one may grow rich without do any work
this method i repeat have a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without take any trouble we almost invariably to a certain extent that be true assent the frenchman with a air
oh no it be not true put in the general sternly
and you he add to me you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traduce your own country i beg pardon i say
yet it would be difficult to say which be the bad of the ineptitude or the german method of grow rich through honest what an extraordinary idea cry the general
and what a idea add the frenchman
i smile for i be rather glad to have a quarrel with them
i would rather live a wandering life in tent i cry than bow the knee to a german idol to idol exclaim the general now seriously angry
to the german method of heap up rich
i have not be here very long but i can tell you that what i have see and verify make my tartar blood boil
good lord
i wish for no virtue of that kind
yesterday i go for a walk of about ten verst and everywhere i find that thing be even as we read of them in good german every house have its vater who be horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable
so honourable be he that it be dreadful to have anything to do with him and i can not bear people of that sort
each such vater have his family and in the evening they read improve book aloud
over their there murmur elm and chestnuts the sun have sink to his rest a stork be roost on the gable and all be beautifully poetic and touch
do not be angry general
let me tell you something that be even more touching than that
i can remember how of an evening my own father now dead use to sit under the lime tree in his little garden and to read book aloud to myself and my mother
yes i know how thing ought to be do
yet every german family be bind to slavery and to submission to its they work like ox and amass wealth like jew
suppose the vater have put by a certain number of gülden which he hand over to his eldest son in order that the say son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land
well one result be to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded
for the same reason the parent will have to sell the young son into bondage or the rank of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital
yes such thing be do for i have be make inquiry on the subject
it be all do out of sheer of a rectitude which be magnify to the point of the young son believing that he have be sell and that it be simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he be make over into pledge
what more have i to tell
well matter bear just as hardly upon the eldest son
perhaps he have his gretchen to whom his heart be bind but he can not marry her for the reason that he have not yet amass sufficient gülden
so the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while
gretchen s cheek grow sunken and she begin to wither until at last after some twenty year their substance have multiply and sufficient gülden have be honourably and virtuously accumulate
then the vater bless his heir and the gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he burst into tear read the pair a lesson on morality and dy
in turn the eldest son become a virtuous vater and the old story begin again
in fifty or sixty year time the grandson of the original vater will have amass a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to son and so on for several generation until at length there will issue a baron rothschild or a hoppe and company or the devil know what
be it not a beautiful spectacle of a century or two of inherit labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sit on the roof above it all
what be more they think there can never be anything good than this wherefore from point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who be at be to say who be not exactly like themselves
yes there you have it in a nutshell
for my own part i would rather grow fat after the russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette
i have no wish to be hoppe and company at the end of five generation
i want the money for for in no way do i look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be give over to capital
i may be wrong but there you have it
those be how far you may be right in what you have say i do not know remark the general moodily but i know that you be become an insufferable whenever you be give the least as usual he leave his sentence unfinished
indeed whenever he embark upon anything that in the least exceed the limit of daily he leave unfinished what he be say
the frenchman have listen to me contemptuously with a slight protruding of his eye but he could not have understood very much of my harangue
as for polina she have look on with serene indifference
she seem to have hear neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal
v yes she have be extraordinarily meditative
yet on leave the table she immediately order me to accompany her for a walk
we take the child with us and set out for the fountain in the park
i be in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt fashion i blurt out a question as to why our marquis de griers have cease to accompany her for stroll or to speak to her for day because he be a brute she reply in rather a curious way
it be the first time that i have hear her speak so of de griers consequently i be momentarily awe into silence by this expression of resentment
have you notice too that today he be by no mean on good term with the general i go on
i suppose you want to know why she reply with dry captiousness
you be aware be you not that the general be mortgage to the marquis with all his property
consequently if the general s mother do not die the frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now hold only in then it be really the case that everything be mortgage
i have hear rumour to that effect but be unaware how far they might be yes they true
what then why it will be a case of farewell mlle
blanche i remark for in such an event she would never become madame general
do you know i believe the old man be so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over
at his age it be a dangerous thing to fall in yes something i believe happen to him assented polina thoughtfully
and what a fine thing it all be i continue
could anything be more abominable than the way in which she have agree to marry for money alone
not one of the decency have be observe the whole affair have take place without the least ceremony
and as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she be dead
what do you think of it polina alexandrovna yes it be very horrible she interrupt with a shudder
consequently i be the more surprised that should be so cheerful
what be so pleased about
about the fact that you have go and lose my money what
the money that you give me to lose
i tell you i should never win for other of all for you
i obey you simply because you order me to but you must not blame me for the result
i warn you that no good would ever come of it
you seem much depress at have lose your money
why do you need it so greatly why do ask me these question because you promise to explain matter to me
listen
i be certain that as soon as ever i begin to play for myself and i still have gülden leave i shall win
you can then take of me what you she make a contemptuous grimace
you must not be angry with me i continue for make such a proposal
i be so conscious of be only a nonentity in your eye that you need not mind accept money from me
a gift from me could not possibly offend you
moreover it be i who lose your she glance at me but see that i be in an irritable sarcastic mood change the subject
my affair can not possibly interest you she say
still if you wish to know i be in debt
i borrow some money and must pay it back again
i have a curious senseless idea that i be bind to win at the
why i think so i can not tell but i do think so and with some assurance
perhaps it be because of that assurance that i now find myself without any other or perhaps it be because it be so for you to win
it be like a drown man catch at a straw
you yourself will agree that unless he be drown he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a polina look surprised
what she say
do not you also hope something from it
do you not tell me again and again two week ago that you be certain of win at roulette if you play here
and do you not ask me not to consider you a fool for do so
be you joke
you can not have be for i remember that you speak with a gravity which forbid the idea of your true i reply gloomily
i always felt certain that i should win
indeed what you say make me ask have my absurd senseless loss of today raise a doubt in my mind
yet i be positive that so soon as ever i begin to play for myself i shall infallibly and why be you so certain to tell the truth i do not know
i only know that i it be the one resource i have leave
yes why do i feel so assure on the point perhaps because one can not help win if one be fanatically certain of do yet i dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter i do not care whether you be so or not answer polina with calm indifference
well since you ask me i doubt your ability to take anything seriously
you be capable of worry but not deeply
you be too and unsettle a person for that
but why do you want money
not a single one of the reason which you have give can be look upon as by the way i interrupt you say you want to pay off a debt
it must be a large one
be it to the frenchman what do you mean by ask all these question
you be very clever today
surely you be not drunk you know that you and i stand on no ceremony and that sometimes i put to you very plain question
i repeat that i be your slave can not be sham or you talk like a child
it be always possible to comport oneself with dignity
if one have a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade a maxim straight from the copybook
suppose i comport myself with dignity
by that i mean that though i be a man of i be unable to carry off a situation properly
do you know the reason
it be because we russian be too richly and multifariously gift to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression
it be all a question of mode
most of us be so bounteously endow with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour
and genius be lack in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists
it belong only to the a few other european have elaborate their form so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified person
that be why with us the mode be so
the frenchman may receive an real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown
but a tweaking of the nose he can not bear for the reason that such an act be an infringement of the accept of the order of decorum
that be why our good lady be so fond of frenchman s manner they say be perfect
but in my opinion there be no such thing as a frenchman s manner
the frenchman be only a
at the same time as i be not a woman i do not properly understand the question
cock may be excellent bird
if i be wrong you must stop me
you ought to stop and correct me more often when i be speak to you for i be too apt to say everything that be in my head
you see i have lose my manner
i agree that i have none nor yet any dignity
i will tell you why
i set no store upon such thing
everything in me have undergone a cheek
you know the reason
i have not a single human thought in my head
for a long while i have be ignorant of what be go on in the or in russia
i have be to dresden yet be completely in the dark as to what dresden be like
you know the cause of my obsession
i have no hope now and be a mere cipher in your eye wherefore i tell you outright that wherever i go i see only the rest be a matter of indifference
why or how i have come to love you i do not know
it may be that you be not altogether fair to look upon
do you know i be ignorant even as to what your face be like
in all probability too your heart be not comely and it be possible that your mind be wholly and because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money she say
have i think to do so be my reply
you be lose the thread of the argument
if you do not wish to purchase me at all event you wish to purchase my not at all
i have tell you that i find it difficult to explain myself
you be hard upon me
do not be angry at my chattering
you know why you ought not to be angry with i be simply an imbecile
however i do not mind if you angry
sit in my room i need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once i fall almost to bite my hand
why should you be angry with me
because i call myself your slave
revel i pray you in my in it
do you know that sometimes i could kill you because i do not love you or be jealous of you but because i feel as though i could simply devour you you be laugh no i be not she retort
but i order you nevertheless to be she stop well nigh breathless with anger
god know she may not have be a beautiful woman yet i love to see her come to a halt like this and be therefore the more fond of arouse her temper
perhaps she divine this and for that very reason give way to rage
i say as much to her
what rubbish she cry with a shudder
i do not care i continue
also do you know that it be not safe for us to take walk together
often i have a feeling that i should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you
be you certain that it will never come to that
you be drive me to frenzy
be i afraid of a scandal or of your anger
why should i fear your anger
i love without hope and know that hereafter i shall love you a thousand time more
if ever i should kill you i should have to kill myself too
but i shall put off do so as long as possible for i wish to continue enjoy the unbearable pain which your coldness give me
do you know a very strange thing
it be that with every day my love for you that would seem to be almost an impossibility
why should i not become a fatalist
remember how on the third day that we ascend the shlangenberg i be move to whisper in your ear say but the word and i will leap into the had you say it i should have leapt
do you not believe me what stupid rubbish she cry
i care not whether it be wise or stupid i cry in return
i only know that in your presence i must speak speak speak
therefore i be speak
i lose all conceit when i be with you and everything cease to why should i have want you to leap from the shlangenberg she say drily and i think with wilful offensiveness
would have be of no use to splendid i shout
i know well that you must have use the word of no use in order to crush me
can see through you
of no use do you say
why to give pleasure be of use and as for barbarous unlimited if it be only over a it be a kind of luxury
man be a despot by nature and love to torture
you in particular love to do i remember that at this moment she look at me in a peculiar way
the fact be that my face must have be express all the maze of senseless gross sensation which be seethe within me
to this day i can remember word for word the conversation as i have write it down
my eye be suffuse with blood and the foam have cake itself on my lip
also on my honour i swear that have she bid me cast myself from the summit of the shlangenberg i should have do it
yes have she bid me in jest or only in contempt and with a spit in my face i should have cast myself down
oh no
why so
i believe you she say but in such a the manner of which at time she be a with such a note of disdain and viperish arrogance in her tone that god know i could have kill her
yes at that moment she stand in peril
i have not lie to her about that
surely you be not a coward suddenly she ask me
i do not know i reply
perhaps i be but i do not know
i have long give up think about such if i say to you kill that man would you kill him whom whomsoever i wish the frenchman do not ask me question return me answer
i repeat whomsoever i wish
i desire to see if you be speak seriously just she await my reply with such gravity and impatience that i find the situation unpleasant
do rather tell me i say what be go on here
why do you seem of me
i can see for myself what be wrong
you be the of a ruin and insensate man who be smite with love for this devil of a blanche
and there be this frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you
yet you actually ask me such a question
if you do not tell me how thing stand i shall have to put in my oar and do something
be you ashamed to be frank with me
be you shy of me i be not go to talk to you on that subject
i have ask you a question and be wait for an well will kill whomsoever you wish i say
but be you go to bid me do such deed why should you think that i be go to let you off
i shall bid you do it or else renounce me
could you ever do the latter
no you know that you couldn t
you would first kill whom i have bid you and then kill for have dare to send you away something seem to strike upon my brain as i hear these word
of course at the time i take them half in jest and half as a challenge yet she have speak them with great seriousness
i felt thunderstruck that she should so express herself that she should assert such a right over me that she should assume such authority and say outright either you kill whom i bid you or i will have nothing more to do with indeed in what she have say there be something so cynical and unveiled as to pass all bound
for how could she ever regard me as the same after the killing be do
this be more than slavery and abasement it be sufficient to bring a man back to his right sens
yet despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation my heart shook within me
suddenly she burst out laugh
we be seat on a bench near the spot where the child be opposite the point in the before the casino where the carriage draw up in order to set down their occupant
do you see that fat baroness she cry
it be the baroness burmergelm
she arrive three day ago
just look at her tall wizened prussian there with the stick in his hand
do you remember how he star at us the other day
well go to the baroness take off your hat to her and say something in why because you have swear that you would leap from the shlangenberg for my sake and that you would kill any one whom i might bid you kill
well instead of such murder and tragedy i wish only for a good laugh
go without answer me and let me see the baron give you a sound thrashing with his then you throw me out a challenge think that i will not do it yes i do challenge you
go for such be my then i go however mad be your fancy
only look here shall you not be do the general a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself
it be not about myself i be be about you and the general
why for a mere fancy should i go and insult a woman ah
then i can see that you be only a trifler she say contemptuously
your eye be swim with only because you have drink a little too much at luncheon
do i not know that what i have ask you to do be foolish and wrong and that the general will be angry about it
but i want to have a good laugh all the same
i want that and nothing else
why should you insult a woman indeed
well you will be give a sound thrash for so i turn away and go silently to do her bidding
of course the thing be folly but i could not get out of it
i remember that as i approach the baroness i felt as excite as a schoolboy
i be in a frenzy as though i be drunk
vi two day have pass since that day of lunacy
what a noise and a fuss and a chattering and an uproar there be
and what a welter of unseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manner
and the cause of it all
yet part of the scene be also all event to myself it be so
i be not quite sure what be the matter with i be merely stupefy or whether i purposely break loose and run amok
at time my mind seem all confuse while at other time i seem almost to be back in my childhood at the school desk and to have do the deed simply out of mischief
it all come of of polina
but for her there might never have be a fracas
or perhaps i do the deed in a fit of despair though it may be foolish of me to think so
what there be so attractive about her i can not think
yet there something attractive about pass fair it would seem
others besides myself she have drive to distraction
she be tall and straight and very slim
her body look as though it could be tie into a knot or bent double like a cord
the imprint of her foot be long and narrow
it be a madden simply a madden one
and her hair have a reddish tint about it and her eye be like cat s able also to glance with proud disdainful mien
on the evening of my first arrival four month ago i remember that she be sit and hold an animated conversation with de griers in the salon
and the way in which she look at him be such that later when i retire to my own room upstairs i keep fancy that she have smite him in the she have smite him right on the cheek so peculiar have be her look as she stand confront him
ever since that even i have love her
but to my tale
i step from the path into the and take my stand in the middle of it
there i await the baron and the baroness
when they be but a few pace distant from me i take off my hat and bow
i remember that the baroness be clothe in a voluminous silk dress pale grey in colour and adorn with flounce and a crinoline and train
also she be short and inordinately stout while her gross flabby chin completely conceal her neck
her face be purple and the little eye in it have an impudent malicious expression
yet she walk as though she be confer a favour upon everybody by so do
as for the baron he be tall wizened after the german fashion spectacled and apparently about year of age
also he have leg which seem to begin almost at his rather at his chin
yet for all his air of conceit his clothes sag a little and his face wear a sheepish air which might have pass for profundity
these detail i note within a space of a few second
at first my bow and the fact that i have my hat in my hand barely catch their attention
the baron only scowl a little and the baroness sweep straight on
madame la baronne say i loudly and each word as it j ai l honneur d être votre then i bow again put on my hat and walk past the baron with a rude smile on my face
polina have order me merely to take off my hat the bow and the general effrontery be of my own invention
god know what instigate me to perpetrate the outrage
in my frenzy i felt as though i be walk on air
hein rather baron as he turn towards me in angry surprise
i too turned round and stand wait in expectation
yet still i wore on my face an impudent smile as i gaze at him
he seem to hesitate and his brow contract to their utmost limit
every moment his visage be grow darker
the baroness also turn in my direction and gaze at me in wrathful perplexity while some of the also begin to stare at us and others of them halt outright
hein the baron vociferate again with a redoubled growl and a note of grow wrath in his voice
ja wohl i reply still look him in the eye
sind sie rasend he exclaim brandish his stick and apparently begin to feel nervous
perhaps it be my costume which intimidate him for i be well and fashionably dress after the manner of a man who belong to indisputably good society
ja cry i again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling of the ohl sound after the fashion of the berliner who constantly use the phrase ja wohl in conversation and more or less prolong the syllable ohl accord as they desire to express different shade of mean or of mood
at this the baron and the baroness face sharply about and almost flee in their alarm
some of the bystander give vent to excited exclamation and others remain star at me in astonishment
but i do not remember the detail very well
wheel quietly about i return in the direction of polina alexandrovna
but when i have get within a hundred pace of her seat i saw her rise and set out with the child towards the hotel
at the portico i catch up to her
i have perpetrate piece of idiocy i say as i come level with her
have you
then you can take the consequence she reply without so much as look at me
then she move towards the staircase
i spend the rest of the even walking in the park
thence i pass into the forest and walk on until i find myself in a neighbouring principality
at a wayside restaurant i partook of an omelette and some wine and be charge for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half
not until eleven o clock do i return find a summons await me from the general
our party occupy two suite in the hotel each of which contain two room
the first the large suite comprise a salon and a with adjoin the latter the general s study
it be here that he be await me as he stand pose in a majestic attitude beside his
loll on a divan close by be de griers
my good sir the general begin may i ask you what this be that you have go and do i should be glad i reply if we could come straight to the point
probably you be refer to my encounter of today with a german with a german
why the german be the baron most important personage
i hear that you have be rude both to him and to the baroness no i have but i understand that you simply terrify them my good sir shout the general
not in the least i reply
you must know that when i be in berlin i frequently use to hear the berliner repeat and repellently prolong a certain ja wohl and happen to meet this couple in the i find for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recur to my memory and exercise a rousing effect upon my spirit
moreover on the three previous occasion that i have meet the baroness she have walk towards me as though i be a worm which could easily be crush with the foot
not unnaturally i too possess a measure of wherefore on occasion i take off my hat and say politely yes i assure you it be say politely madame j ai l honneur d être votre then the baron turn round and say hein whereupon i felt move to ejaculate in answer ja wohl twice i shout it at first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the great prolonging of the word of which i be capable
that be i must confess that this puerile explanation give me great pleasure
i felt a strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure of grossness so the further i proceed the more do the gusto of my proceeding increase
you be only make fun of me vociferate the general as turn to the frenchman he declare that my bring about of the incident have be gratuitous
de griers smile contemptuously and shrug his shoulder
do not think i put in
it be not so at all
i grant you that my behaviour be fully confess that it be so and make no secret of the fact
i would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be call stupid and indecent tomfoolery but than that it be not
also let me tell you that i be very sorry for my conduct
yet there be one circumstance which in my eye almost absolves me from regret in the matter
of be to say for the last two or three have be feel not at all well
that be to say i have be in a sick nervous irritable fanciful condition so that i have periodically lose control over myself
for instance on more than one occasion i have try to pick a quarrel even with monsieur le marquise here and under the circumstance he have no choice but to answer me
in short i have recently be show sign of
whether the baroness burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when i come to beg her pardon for i intend to make her amends i do not know but i doubt if she will and the less so since so far as i know the circumstance be one which of late have begin to be abuse in the legal world in that advocate in criminal case have take to justify their client on the ground that at the moment of the crime they the client be unconscious of what they be in short they be out of health
my client commit the be true but he have no recollection of have commit and doctor actually support these advocate by affirm that there really be such a there really arise temporary delusion which make a man remember nothing of a give deed or only a half or a quarter of it
but the baron and baroness be member of an old generation as well as prussian junker and landowner
to them such a process in the world will be unknown and therefore they be the more unlikely to accept any such explanation
what be opinion about it general enough sir he thunder with barely restrain fury
enough i say
once and for all i must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence
to justify yourself in the eye of the baron and baroness will be impossible
any intercourse with you even though it be confine to a begging of their pardon they would look upon as a degradation
i may tell you that on learn that you form part of my household the baron approach me in the casino and demand of me additional satisfaction
do you understand then what it be that you have entail upon my good sir
you have entail upon me the fact of my be force to sue humbly to the baron and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment excuse me general i interrupt but do he make an express point of it that i should cease to belong to your establishment as you call it no i of my own initiative thought that i ought to afford him that satisfaction and with it he be satisfied
so we must part good sir
it be my duty to hand over to you forty gülden three florin as per the accompanying statement
here be the money and here the account which you be at liberty to verify
farewell
from henceforth we be stranger
from you i have never have anything but trouble and unpleasantness
i be about to call the landlord and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards i shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expense
also i have the honour to remain your obedient i take the money and the account which be indict in pencil and bow low to the general say to him very gravely the matter can not end here
i regret very much that you should have be put to unpleasantness at the baron s hand but the fault pardon me be your own
how come you to answer for me to the baron
and what do you mean by say that i form part of your household
i be merely your family a son of yours nor yet your ward nor a person of any kind for whose act you need be responsible
i be a judicially competent person a man of year of age a university graduate a gentleman and until i meet yourself a complete stranger to you
only my boundless respect for your merit restrains me from demand satisfaction at your hand as well as a further explanation as to the reason which have lead you to take it upon yourself to answer for my so struck be he with my word that spread out his hand he turn to the frenchman and interpret to him that i have challenge himself the general to a duel
the frenchman laugh aloud
nor do i intend to let the baron off i continue calmly but with not a little discomfiture at de griers merriment
and since you general have today be so good as to listen to the baron s complaint and to enter into his you have make yourself a participator in the have the honour to inform you that tomorrow morning at the late i shall in my own name demand of the say baron a formal explanation as to the reason which have lead him to disregard the fact that the matter lie between him and myself alone and to put a slight upon me by refer it to another person as though i be unworthy to answer for my own then there happen what i have foreseen
the general on hearing of this further intend outrage show the white feather
what he cry
do you intend to go on with this damn nonsense
do you not realise the harm that it be do me
i beg of you not to laugh at me to laugh at me for we have police authority here who out of respect for my rank and for that of the baron
in short sir i swear to you that i will have you arrest and march out of the place to prevent any further brawling on your part
do you understand what i say he be almost breathless with anger as well as in a terrible fright
general i reply with that calmness which he never could abide one can not arrest a man for brawl until he have brawl
i have not so much as begin my explanation to the baron and you be altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure be likely to assume
i wish but to disabuse the baron of what be to me a shameful that i be under the guardianship of a person who be qualify to exercise control over my free will
it be vain for you to disturb and alarm for god s sake alexis ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours he mutter but with a sudden change from a truculent tone to one of entreaty as he catch me by the hand
do you know what be likely to come of it
merely further unpleasantness
you will agree with me i be sure that at present i ought to move with especial with very especial care
you can not be fully aware of how i be situate
when we leave this place i shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time be well i can not tell you all my with that he wind up in a despairing voice o alexis ivanovitch alexis ivanovitch i move towards the him to be calm and promising that everything should be do decently and in order whereafter i depart
russian when abroad be to play the poltroon to watch all their word and to wonder what people be think of their conduct or whether such and such a thing be il
in short they be to cosset themselves and to lay claim to great importance
always they prefer the form of behaviour which have once and for all become accepted and establish
this they will follow slavishly whether in hotel on promenade at meeting or when on a journey
but the general have avow to me that over and above such consideration as these there be circumstance which compel him to move with especial care at present and that the fact have actually make him and a have make him altogether change his tone towards me
this fact i take into my calculation and duly note it for of course he apply to the authority tomorrow and it behove me to go carefully
yet it be not the general but polina that i want to anger
she have treat me with such cruelty and have get me into such a hole that i felt a longing to force her to beseech me to stop
of course my tomfoolery might compromise her yet certain other feeling and desire have begin to form themselves in my brain
if i be never to rank in her eye as anything but a nonentity it would not greatly matter if i figure as a cockerel and the baron be to give me a good thrashing but the fact be that i desire to have the laugh of them all and to come out myself unscathed
let people see what they see
let polina for once have a good fright and be force to whistle me to heel again
but however much she might whistle she should see that i be at least no cockerel
i have just receive a surprising piece of news
i have just meet our chambermaid on the stair and be inform by her that maria philipovna depart today by the night train to stay with a cousin at carlsbad
what can that mean
the maid declare that madame pack her trunk early in the day
yet how be it that no one else seem to have be aware of the circumstance
or be it that have be the only person to be unaware of it
also the maid have just tell me that three day ago maria philipovna have some high word with the general
i understand then
probably the word be concern mlle
blanche
certainly something decisive be approach
vii in the morning i send for the maître d hôtel and explain to him that in future my bill be to be render to me personally
as a matter of fact my expense have never be so large as to alarm me nor to lead me to quit the hotel while moreover i still have gülden leave to me in them perhaps rich await me
it be a curious fact that though i have not yet win anything at play i nevertheless act thought and felt as though i be sure before long to become i could not imagine myself otherwise
next i bethink me despite the earliness of the hour of go to see astley who be stay at the hôtel de l angleterre a hostelry at no great distance from our own
but suddenly de griers enter my room
this have never before happen for of late that gentleman and i have stand on the most strained and distant of attempt no concealment of his contempt for me he even make an express point of show it and i have no reason to desire his company
in short i detest him
consequently his entry at the present moment the more astounded me
at once i divine that something out of the way be on the carpet
he enter with marked affability and begin by compliment me on my room
then perceive that i have my hat in my hand he inquire whither i be go so early and no sooner do he hear that i be bind for astley s than he stop look grave and seem plunge in thought
he be a true frenchman insofar as that though he could be lively and engage when it suit him he become insufferably dull and wearisome as soon as ever the need for be lively and engage have pass
seldom be a frenchman civil he be civil only as though to order and of set purpose
also if he think it incumbent upon him to be fanciful original and out of the way his fancy always assume a foolish unnatural vein for the reason that it be compound of trite hackneyed form
in short the natural frenchman be a conglomeration of commonplace petty everyday positiveness so that he be the most tedious person in the world
indeed i believe that none but greenhorn and excessively russian people feel an attraction towards the french for to any man of sensibility such a compendium of outworn compendium which be build up of manner expansiveness and at once and unbearable
i have come to see you on business de griers begin in a very yet polite tone nor will i seek to conceal from you the fact that i have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the general
have small knowledge of the russian tongue i lose most of what be say last night but the general have now explain matter and i must confess see here monsieur de griers i interrupt
i understand that you have undertake to act in this affair as an intermediary
of course i be only un utchitel a tutor and have never claim to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar term with it
consequently i do not know the whole of its circumstance
yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its member see that you be begin to take such a part in everything and be now present as an intermediary the frenchman seem not at my question
it be one which be too outspoken for his he have no mind to be frank with me
i be connect with the general he say drily partly through business affair and partly through special circumstance
my principal have send me merely to ask you to forego your intention of last evening
what you contemplate be i have no doubt very clever yet he have charge me to represent to you that you have not the slight chance of succeed in your end since not only will the baron refuse to receive you but also he the baron have at his disposal every possible mean for obviate further unpleasantness from you
surely you can see that yourself
what then would be the good of go on with it all
on the other hand the general promise that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household and in the meantime will credit you with your vos surely that will suit you will it not very quietly i reply that he the frenchman be labour under a delusion that perhaps after all i should not be expel from the baron s presence but on the contrary be listen to finally that i should be glad if monsieur de griers would confess that he be now visit me merely in order to see how far i intend to go in the affair
good heaven cry de griers
see that the general take such an interest in the matter be there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plan again i begin my explanation but the frenchman only fidget and roll his head about as he listen with an expression of manifest and unconcealed irony on his face
in short he adopt a supercilious attitude
for my own part i endeavour to pretend that i take the affair very seriously
i declare that since the baron have go and complain of me to the general as though i be a mere servant of the general s he have in the first place lose me my post and in the second place treat me like a person to whom as to one not qualify to answer for himself it be not even worth while to speak
naturally i say i felt insult at this
yet comprehend as i do difference of year of social status and so forth here i could scarcely help smile i be not anxious to bring about further scene by go personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the baron
all that i felt be that i have a right to go in person and beg the baron s and the baroness s more so since of late i have be feel unwell and unstrung and have be in a fanciful condition
and so forth and so forth
yet i continue the baron s offensive behaviour to me of yesterday that be to say the fact of his refer the matter to the general as well as his insistence that the general should deprive me of my post have place me in such a position that i could not well express my regret to him the baron and to his good lady for the reason that in all probability both he and the baroness with the world at large would imagine that i be do so merely because i hop by my action to recover my post
hence i find myself force to request the baron to express to me regret as well as to express them in the most unqualified say in fact that he have never have any wish to insult me
after the baron have do i should for my part at once feel free to express to him and without reserve my own regret
in short i declare in conclusion my one desire be that the baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter oh fie
what refinement and subtlety exclaim de griers
besides what have you to express regret for
confess monsieur me but i have forget your i say that all this be merely a plan to annoy the general
or perhaps you have some other and special end in view
eh in return you must pardon mon cher marquis and tell me what have to do with the but what of the general
last night he say that for some reason or another it behove him to move with especial care at present wherefore he be feel nervous
but i do not understand the yes there exist special reason for his do so assent de griers in a conciliatory tone yet with rise anger
you be acquaint with mlle
de cominges be you not mlle
blanche you mean yes mlle
blanche de cominges
doubtless you know also that the general be in love with this young lady and may even be about to marry her before he leave here
imagine therefore what any scene or scandal would entail upon him i can not see that the marriage scheme need be affect by scene or mais le baron est si caractère prussien vous savez
enfin il fera une querelle d i do not care i reply see that i no longer belong to his household of set purpose i be try to talk as senselessly as possible
but be it quite settle that mlle
be to marry the general
what be they wait for
why should they conceal such a all event from ourselves the general s own party i can not tell you
the marriage be not yet a settled affair for they be await news from russia
the general have business transaction to ah
connect doubtless with madame his mother de griers shoot at me a glance of hatred
to cut thing short he interrupt i have complete confidence in your native politeness as well as in your tact and good sense
i feel sure that you will do what i suggest even if it be only for the sake of this family which have receive you as a kinsman into its bosom and have always love and respect be so good as to observe i remark that the same family have just me from its bosom
all that you be say you be say but for show but when people have just say to you of course we do not wish to turn you out yet for the sake of appearance s you must yourself to be turn out nothing can matter very very well then he say in a sterner and more arrogant tone
see that my solicitation have have no effect upon you it be my duty to mention that other measure will be take
there exist here police you must remember and this very day they shall send you pack
que diable
to think of a blanc bec like yourself challenge a person like the baron to a duel
do you suppose that you will be to do such thing
just try do them and see if any one will be afraid of you
the reason why i have ask you to desist be that i can see that your conduct be cause the general annoyance
do you believe that the baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of door nevertheless i should not go out of door i retort with absolute calm
you be labour under a delusion monsieur de griers
the thing will be do in far good trim than you imagine
i be just about to start for astley s to ask him to be my other word my second
he have a strong liking for me and i do not think that he will refuse
he will go and see the baron on my behalf and the baron will certainly not decline to receive him
although i be only a kind of subaltern astley be know to all men as the nephew of a real english lord the lord piebroch as well as a lord in his own right
yes you may be pretty sure that the baron will be civil to astley and listen to him
or should he decline to do so astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself for you know how persistent the english be
and thereupon introduce to the baron a friend of his own and he have many friend in a good position
that be so picture to yourself the issue of the affair which will not quite end as you think it this cause the frenchman to bethink him of play the coward
really thing may be as this fellow say he evidently think
really he be able to engineer another once more i beg of you to let the matter drop he continue in a tone that be now entirely conciliatory
one would think that it actually you to have scene
indeed it be a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you be seek
i have say that the affair may prove to be divert and even clever and that possibly you may attain something by it yet none the less i tell you he say this only because he saw me rise and reach for my hat that i have come hither also to hand you these few word from a certain person
read them please for i must take her back an so say he take from his pocket a small compact note and hand it to me
in polina s handwrite i read i hear that you be think of go on with this affair
you have lose your temper now and be begin to play the fool
certain circumstance however i may explain to you later
pray cease from your folly and put a check upon yourself
for folly it all be
i have need of you and moreover you have promise to obey me
remember the shlangenberg
i ask you to be obedient
if necessary i shall even you be own polina
so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what happen last night pray forgive everything to my eye seem to change as i read these word
my lip grow pale and i begin to tremble
meanwhile the cursed frenchman be eye me discreetly and askance as though he wish to avoid witness my confusion
it would have be better if he have laugh outright
very well i say you can tell mlle
not to disturb herself
but i add sharply i would also ask you why you have be so long in hand me this note
instead of chatter about trifle you ought to have deliver me the missive at you have really come commission as you well pardon some natural haste on my part for the situation be so strange
i wish first to gain some personal knowledge of your intention and moreover i do not know the content of the note and think that it could be give you at any i understand i reply
so you be order to hand me the note only in the last resort and if you could not otherwise appease me
be it not so
speak out monsieur de perhaps say he assume a look of great forbearance but gaze at me in a meaning way
i reach for my hat whereupon he nod and go out
yet on his lip i fancy that i could see a mocking smile
how could it have be otherwise
you and i be to have a reckoning later master frenchman i mutter as i descend the stair
yes we will measure our strength yet my thought be all in confusion for again something seem to have strike me dizzy
presently the air revive me a little and a couple of minute later my brain have sufficiently clear to enable two idea in particular to stand out in it
firstly i ask myself which of the absurd boyish and extravagant threat which i have utter at random last night have make everybody so alarmed
secondly what be the influence which this frenchman appear to exercise over polina
he have but to give the word and at once she do as he once she write me a note to beg of me to forbear
of course the relation between the pair have from the first be a riddle to have be so ever since i have first make their acquaintance
but of late i have remark in her a strong aversion for even a contempt while for his part he have scarcely even look at her but have behave towards her always in the most churlish fashion
yes i have note that
also polina herself have mention to me her dislike for him and deliver herself of some remarkable confession on the subject
hence he must have get her into his power he must be hold her as in a vice
viii all at once on the promenade as it be be to say in the chestnut come face to face with my englishman
i be just come to see you he say and you appear to be out on a similar errand
so you have part with your employer how do you know that i ask in astonishment
be aware of the fact by no mean
not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment
indeed i have never hear any one speak of then how come you to know it because i have have occasion to do so
whither be you bound
i like you and be therefore come to pay you a what a splendid fellow you be astley i cry though still wonder how he have come by his knowledge
and since i have not yet have my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely taste yours let us adjourn to the casino café where we can sit and smoke and have a the café in question be only a hundred pace away so when coffee have be bring we seat ourselves and i light a cigarette
astley be no smoker but take a seat by my side he prepare himself to listen
i do not intend to go away be my first remark
i intend on the contrary to remain that i never doubt he answer
it be a curious fact that on my way to see him i have never even think of tell him of my love for polina
in fact i have purposely mean to avoid any mention of the subject
nor during our stay in the place have i ever make aught but the scanty reference to it
you see not only be astley a man of great reserve but also from the first i have perceive that polina have make a great impression upon him although he never speak of her
but now strangely enough he have no sooner seat himself and bend his steely gaze upon me than for some reason or another i felt move to tell him speak to him of my love in all its phase
for an hour and a half do i discourse on the subject and find it a pleasure to do so even though this be the first occasion on which i have refer to the matter
indeed when at certain moment i perceive that my more ardent passage confuse him i purposely increased my ardour of narration
yet one thing i regret and that be that i make reference to the frenchman which be a little
astley sit without move as he listen to me
not a word nor a sound of any kind do he utter as he star into my eye
suddenly however on my mention the frenchman he interrupt me and inquire sternly whether i do right to speak of an extraneous matter he have always be a strange man in his mode of propound question
no i fear not i reply
and concern this marquis and mlle
polina you know nothing beyond surmise again i be surprise that such a categorical question should come from such a reserve individual
no i know nothing about them be my reply
then you have do very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine thing about quite so quite so i interrupt in some astonishment
i admit that
yet that be not the whereupon i relate to him in detail the incident of two day ago
i spoke of polina s outburst of my encounter with the baron of my dismissal of the general s extraordinary pusillanimity and of the call which de griers have that morning pay me
in conclusion i show astley the note which i have lately receive
what do you make of it i ask
when i meet you i be just come to ask you your opinion
for myself i could have kill this frenchman and be not sure that i shall not do so even i feel the same about it say astley
as for mlle
you yourself know that if necessity drive one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests
even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depend upon extraneous circumstance
for my own part i think that you may reassure at all event partially
and as for mlle
polina s proceeding of two day ago they be of course strange not because she can have mean to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrash from the baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he do not use although he have it ready in his hand but because such proceeding on the part of of such a refined lady as mlle
polina be to say the least of it unbecoming
but she can not have guess that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter do you know what suddenly i cry as i fix astley with my gaze
i believe that you have already hear the story from some possibly from mlle
polina herself in return he give me an astonished stare
your eye look very fiery he say with a return of his former calm and in them i can read suspicion
now you have no right whatever to be suspicious
it be not a right which i can for a moment recognise and i absolutely refuse to answer your enough
you need say no more i cry with a strange emotion at my heart yet not altogether understand what have arouse that emotion in my breast
indeed when where and how could polina have choose astley to be one of her confidant
of late i have come rather to overlook him in this connection even though polina have always be a riddle to much so that now when i have just permit myself to tell my friend of my infatuation in all its aspect i have find myself strike during the very tell with the fact that in my relation with her i could specify nothing that be explicit nothing that be positive
on the contrary my relation have be purely fantastic strange and unreal they have be unlike anything else that i could think of
very well very well i reply with a warmth equal to astley s own
then i stand confound and have no further opinion to offer
but you be a good fellow and i be glad to know what you think about it all even though i do not need your then after a pause i resume for instance what reason should you assign for the general take fright in this way
why should my stupid clowning have lead the world to elevate it into a serious incident
even de griers have find it necessary to put in his oar and he only interfere on the most important occasion and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplication
yes de griers have actually be play the suppliant to and mark you although he come to me as early as nine o clock he have in his hand mlle
polina s note
when i would ask be that note write
mlle
polina must have be arouse from sleep for the express purpose of write it
at all event the circumstance show that she be an absolute slave to the frenchman since she actually beg my pardon in the begs my pardon
yet what be her personal concern in the matter
why be she interested in it at all
why too be the whole party so afraid of this precious baron
and what sort of a business do you call it for the general to be go to marry mlle
blanche de cominges
he tell me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at what be your opinion of it all
your look convinces me that you know more about it than i astley smile and nod
yes i think i know more about it than you do he assent
the affair centre around this mlle
blanche
of that i feel and what of mlle
blanche i cry impatiently for in me there have dawn a sudden hope that this would enable me to discover something about polina
well my belief be that at the present moment mlle
blanche have in very truth a special reason for wish to avoid any trouble with the baron and the baroness
it might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a oh oh also i may tell you that mlle
blanche have be in roulettenberg before for she be stay here three season ago
i myself be in the place at the time and in those day mlle
blanche be not know as mlle
de cominges nor be her mother the widow de cominges even in existence
in any case no one ever mention the latter
de griers too have not materialise and i be convince that not only do the party stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance
likewise the de griers be of recent creation
of that i have reason to be sure owe to a certain circumstance
even the name de griers itself may be take to be a new invention see that i have a friend who once meet the say marquis under a different name yet he possess a good circle of friend possibly
mlle
blanche also may possess that
yet it be not three year since she receive from the local police at the instance of the baroness an invitation to leave the town
and she leave but why well i must tell you that she first appear here in company with an prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name barberini or something of the kind
the fellow be simply a mass of ring and diamonds the couple use to drive out in a marvellous carriage
at first mlle
blanche play trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck take a marked change for the worse
i distinctly remember that in a single evening she lose an enormous sum
but bad be to ensue for one fine morning her prince carriage and all
also the hotel bill which he leave unpaid be enormous
upon this mlle
zelma the name which she assume after figure as madame barberini be in despair
she shriek and howl all over the hotel and even tear her clothes in her frenzy
in the hotel there be stay also a polish count you must know that all travelling pole be count
and the spectacle of mlle
zelma tear her clothes and catlike scratch her face with her beautiful scent nail produce upon him a strong impression
so the pair have a talk together and by luncheon time she be console
indeed that even the couple enter the casino
zelma laugh loudly accord to her custom and show even more expansiveness in her manner than she have before show
for instance she thrust her way into the file of woman in the exact fashion of those lady who to clear a space for themselves at the table push their roughly aside
doubtless you have notice them yes well they be not worth notice
to the annoyance of the decent public they be allow to remain all event such of them as daily change franc note at the table though as soon as ever these woman cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart
however mlle
zelma continue to change note of this kind but her play grow more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such lady luck be frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal
suddenly the count too disappear even as the prince have do and that same evening mlle
zelma be force to appear in the casino alone
on this occasion no one offer her a greeting
two day later she have come to the end of her resource whereupon after stake and lose her last louis d or she chance to look around her and saw standing by her side the baron burmergelm who have be eye her with fixed disapproval
to his distaste however mlle
pay no attention but turn to him with her smile request him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red
later that even a complaint from the baroness lead the authority to request mlle
not to the casino
if you feel in any way surprise that i should know these petty and unedifying detail the reason be that i have them from a relative of mine who later that even drive mlle
zelma in his carriage from roulettenberg to spa
now mark you mlle
want to become madame general in order that in future she may be spar the receipt of such invitation from casino authority as she receive three year ago
at present she be not play but that be only because accord to the sign she be lend money to other player
yes that be a much more pay game
i even suspect that the unfortunate general be himself in her debt as well as perhaps also de griers
or it may be that the latter have enter into a partnership with her
consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have be consummate mlle
would scarcely like to have the attention of the baron and the baroness drawn to herself
in short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental
you form a member of the ménage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a the more so since daily she appear in public arm in arm with the general or with mlle
polina
do you understand no i do not i shout as i bang my fist down upon the it with such violence that a frightened waiter come run towards us
tell me astley why if you know this history all along and consequently always know who this mlle
blanche be you never warn either myself or the general nor most of all mlle
polina who be accustom to appear in the public everywhere with mlle
blanche
how could you do it it would have do no good to warn you he reply quietly for the reason that you could have effect nothing
against what be i to warn you
as likely as not the general know more about mlle
blanche even than i do yet the unhappy man still walk about with her and mlle
polina
only yesterday i saw this frenchwoman rid splendidly mount with de griers while the general be career in their wake on a roan horse
he have say that morning that his leg be hurt him yet his be easy enough
as he pass i look at him and the thought occur to me that he be a man lose for ever
however it be no affair of mine for i have only recently have the happiness to make mlle
polina s acquaintance
also add this as an i have already tell you that i do not recognise your right to ask me certain question however sincere be my like for enough i say rise
to me it be as clear as day that mlle
polina know all about this mlle
blanche but can not bring herself to part with her frenchman wherefore she consent also to be see in public with mlle
blanche
you may be sure that nothing else would ever have induce her either to walk about with this frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the baron
yes it be that the influence lie before which everything in the world must bow
yet she herself it be who launch me at the baron
the devil take it but i be leave no choice in the you forget in the first place that this mlle
de cominges be the general s inamorata and in the second place that mlle
polina the general s have a young brother and sister who though they be the general s own child be completely neglect by this madman and rob as yes yes that be so
for me to go and desert the child now would mean their total abandonment whereas if i remain i should be able to defend their interest and perhaps to save a moiety of their property
yes yes that be quite true
and yet and i can well understand why they be all so interested in the general s mother in whom ask astley
in the old woman of moscow who decline to die yet concern whom they be for ever expect telegram to notify the fact of her ah then of course their interest centre around her
it be a question of succession
let that but be settle and the general will marry mlle
polina will be set free and de yes and de griers will be repay his money which be what he be now wait what
you think that he be wait for i know of nothing else assert astley doggedly
but i do i do i shout in my fury
he be wait also for the old woman s will for the reason that it award mlle
polina a dowry
as soon as ever the money be receive she will throw herself upon the frenchman s neck
all woman be like that
even the proudest of them become abject slave where marriage be concern
what polina be good for be to fall head over ear in love
that be opinion
look at when she be sit alone and plunge in thought
all this be and foretold and be accurse
polina could perpetrate any mad act
who call me by name i break off
who be shout for me
i hear some one call in russian alexis ivanovitch it be a woman s voice
listen at the moment we be approach my hotel
we have leave the café long ago without even notice that we have do so
yes i hear a woman s voice call but whose i do not know
the someone be call you in russian
ah
now i can see whence the cry come
they come from that lady one who be sit on the settee the one who have just be escort to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys
behind her see that pile of luggage
she must have arrive by but why should she be call hear her call again
see
she be beckon to us yes so she be assented astley
alexis ivanovitch alexis ivanovitch
good heaven what a stupid fellow come in a despair wail from the verandah
we have almost reach the portico and i be just set foot upon the space before it when my hand fell to my side in limp astonishment and my foot glue themselves to the pavement
ix for on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah after be carry up the step in an armchair amid a bevy of footman and other menial of the hotel head by the landlord that functionary have actually run out to meet a visitor who arrive with so much stir and din attend by her own retinue and accompany by so great a pile of trunk and portmanteaux the topmost tier of the verandah i say there be grandmother yes it be and imposing and year of vassilievna tarassevitcha landowner and of la baboulenka who have cause so many telegram to be send off and have be die yet not have in her own person descend upon us even as snow might fall from the cloud
though unable to walk she have arrive borne aloft in an armchair her mode of conveyance for the last five year as brisk aggressive loudly imperious and generally abusive as ever
in fact she look exactly as she have on the only two occasion when i have see her since my appointment to the general s household
naturally enough i stand petrified with astonishment
she have sight me a hundred pace off
even while she be be carry along in her chair she have recognise me and call me by name and surname which as usual after hear once she have remember ever afterwards
and this be the woman whom they have think to see in her grave after make her will i think to myself
yet she will outlive us and every one else in the hotel
good lord
what be go to become of us now
what on earth be to happen to the general
she will turn the place upside down my good sir the old woman continue in a stentorian voice what be you stand for with your eye almost fall out of your head
can not you come and say
be you too proud to shake hand
or do you not recognise me
here potapitch she cry to an old servant who dress in a frock coat and white waistcoat have a bald red head he be the chamberlain who always accompany her on her journey
just think
alexis ivanovitch do not recognise me
they have bury me for good and all
yes and after send host of telegram to know if i be dead or not
yes yes i have hear the whole story
i be very much alive though as you may pardon me antonida vassilievna i reply good humouredly as i recover my presence of mind
have no reason to wish you ill
i be merely rather astonish to see you
why should i not be so see how should you be astonish
i just get into my chair and come
thing be quiet enough in the train for there be no one there to chatter
have you be out for a walk yes
i have just be to the oh
well it be quite nice here she go on as she look about her
the place seem comfortable and all the tree be out
i like it very well
be your people at home
be the general for instance indoors yes and probably all of do they observe the convenances and keep up appearance
such thing always give one tone
i have hear that they be keep a carriage even as russian gentlefolk ought to do
when abroad our russian people always cut a dash
be prascovia here too yes
polina alexandrovna be and the frenchwoman
however i will go and look for them myself
tell me the near way to their room
do like be here yes i thank you antonida and you potapitch you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a suitable suite of room
they must be handsomely decorate and not too high up
have my luggage take up to them
but what be you tumble over yourselves for
why be you all tear about
what scullions these fellow be be that with you she add to myself
a astley i reply
and who be astley a and my very good friend as well as an acquaintance of the general oh an englishman
then that be why he star at me without even open his lip
however i like englishman
now take me upstairs direct to their room
where be they lodge madame be lift up in her chair by the lacqueys and i precede her up the grand staircase
our progress be exceedingly effective for everyone whom we meet stop to stare at the cortège
it happen that the hotel have the reputation of be the best the most expensive and the most aristocratic in all the spa and at every turn on the staircase or in the corridor we encounter fine lady and than one of whom hasten downstairs to inquire of the awestruck landlord who the newcomer be
to all such question he return the same that the old lady be an influential foreigner a russian a countess and a and that she have take the suite which during the previous week have be tenant by the grande duchesse de meanwhile the cause of the be borne aloft in her armchair
every person whom she meet she scan with an inquisitive eye after first of all interrogate me about him or her at the top of her voice
she be stout of figure and though she could not leave her chair one felt the moment that one first look at her that she be also tall of stature
her back be as straight as a board and never do she lean back in her seat
also her large grey head with its keen rugged feature remain always erect as she glance about her in an imperious challenge sort of way with look and gesture that clearly be unstudied
though she have reach her year her face be still fresh and her teeth have not decay
lastly she be dress in a black silk gown and white mobcap
she interest me tremendously whisper astley as still smoke he walk by my side
meanwhile i be reflect that probably the old lady know all about the telegram and even about de griers though little or nothing about mlle
blanche
i say as much to astley
but what a frail creature be man
no sooner be my first surprise abate than i find myself rejoice in the shock which we be about to administer to the general
so much do the thought inspire me that i march ahead in the gayest of fashion
our party be lodge on the third floor
without knock at the door or in any way announce our presence i throw open the portal and the grandmother be bear through them in triumph
as though of set purpose the whole party chance at that moment to be assemble in the general s study
the time be eleven o clock and it seem that an outing of some sort at which a portion of the party be to drive in carriage and others to ride on horseback accompany by one or two extraneous acquaintance be be plan
the general be present and also polina the child the latter s nurse de griers mlle
blanche attire in a her mother the young prince and a learned german whom i beheld for the first time
into the midst of this assembly the lacqueys convey madame in her chair and set her down within three pace of the general
good heaven
never shall i forget the spectacle which ensue
just before our entry the general have be hold forth to the company with de griers in support of him
i may also mention that for the last two or three day mlle
blanche and de griers have be make a great deal of the young prince under the very nose of the poor general
in short the company though decorous and conventional be in a gay familiar mood
but no sooner do the grandmother appear than the general stop dead in the middle of a word and with jaw drop star hard at the old eye almost start out of his head and his expression as spellbound as though he have just see a basilisk
in return the grandmother star at him silently and without with a look of mingled challenge triumph and ridicule in her eye
for ten second do the pair remain thus eye one another amid the profound silence of the company and even de griers sit extraordinary look of uneasiness dawn on his face
as for mlle
blanche she too star wildly at the grandmother with eyebrow raise and her lip the prince and the german savant contemplate the tableau in profound amazement
only polina look anything but perplex or surprise
presently however she too turn as white as a sheet and then redden to her temple
truly the grandmother s arrival seem to be a catastrophe for everybody
for my own part i stand look from the grandmother to the company and back again while astley as usual remain in the background and gaze calmly and decorously at the scene
well here i instead of a telegram too the grandmother at last ejaculated to dissipate the silence
what
you be not expect me antonida vassilievna
o my dear mother
but how on earth do you do the muttering of the unhappy general die away
i verily believe that if the grandmother have hold her tongue a few second longer she would have have a stroke
how on earth do i she exclaim
why i just get into the train and come here
what else be the railway meant for
but you think that i have turn up my toe and leave my property to the lot of you
oh i know about the telegram which you have be dispatch
they must have cost you a pretty sum i should think for telegram be not send from abroad for nothing
well i pick up my heel and come here
who be this frenchman
monsieur de griers i suppose oui madame assent de griers
et croyez je suis si enchanté
votre est un miracle vous voir ici
une surprise charmante just so
charmante i happen to know you as a mountebank and therefore trust you no more than she indicate her little finger
and who be she go on turn towards mlle
blanche
evidently the frenchwoman look so become in her with her whip in her hand that she have make an impression upon the old lady
who be that woman there mlle
de cominges i say
and this be her mother madame de cominges
they also be stay in the be the daughter marry ask the old lady without the least semblance of ceremony
no i reply as respectfully as possible but under my breath
be she good company i fail to understand the question
i mean be she or be she not a bore
can she speak russian
when this de griers be in moscow he soon learn to make himself i explain to the old lady that mlle
blanche have never visit russia
bonjour then say madame with sudden brusquerie
bonjour madame reply mlle
blanche with an elegant ceremonious bow as under cover of an unwonted modesty she endeavour to express both in face and figure her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour on the part of the grandmother
how the woman stick out her eye at me
how she mow and mince be the grandmother s comment
then she turn suddenly to the general and continue i have take up my abode here so be go to be your neighbour
be you glad to hear that or be you not my dear mother believe me when i say that i be sincerely delighted return the general who have now to a certain extent recover his sens and inasmuch as when occasion arise he could speak with fluency gravity and a certain effect he set himself to be expansive in his remark and go on we have be so dismayed and upset by the news of your indisposition
we have receive such hopeless telegram about you
then fib fib interrupt the grandmother
how on earth too do you come to decide upon the journey continue the general with raised voice as he hurry to overlook the old lady s last remark
surely at your age and in your present state of health the thing be so unexpected that our surprise be at least intelligible
however i be glad to see you as indeed be we all say this with a dignified yet conciliatory smile and will use my best endeavour to render your stay here as pleasant as enough
all this be empty chatter
you be talk the usual nonsense
i shall know quite well how to spend my time
how do i come to undertake the journey you ask
well be there anything so very surprising about it
it be do quite simply
what be every one go into ecstasy about do you do prascovia
what be do here and how be grandmother replied polina as she approach the old lady
be you long on the journey the most sensible question that i have yet be ask
well you shall hear for yourself how it all happen
i lay and lay and be doctor and doctor until at last i drive the physician from me and call in an apothecary from nicolai who have cure an old woman of a malady similar to my her merely with a little hayseed
well he do me a great deal of good for on the third day i break into a sweat and be able to leave my bed
then my german doctor hold another consultation put on their spectacle and tell me that if i would go abroad and take a course of the water the indisposition would finally pass away
why should it not i think to myself
so i have get thing ready and on the following day a friday set out for here
i occupy a special compartment in the train and where ever i have to change i find at the station bearer who be ready to carry me for a few copper
you have nice quarter here she go on as she glance around the room
but where on earth do you get the money for them my good sir
i think that everything of yours have be mortgage
this frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal
oh i know all about it all about be surprise at you my dear mother say the general in some confusion
be greatly surprised
but i do not need any extraneous control of my finance
moreover my expense do not exceed my income and they do not exceed it
fie
why you be rob your child of their last their guardian after this say the general completely take aback what you have just say i do not know you do not know by heaven be you go to drop that roulette of yours
be you go to whistle all your property away this make such an impression upon the general that he almost choke with fury
roulette indeed
play roulette
really in view of my what you be say my dearest mother
you must still be rubbish rubbish she retort
the truth be that you be get away from that roulette
you be simply tell lie
this very day i mean to go and see for myself what roulette be like
prascovia tell me what there be to be see here and do you alexis ivanovitch show me everything and do you potapitch make me a list of excursion
what there to be see again she inquire of polina
there be a ruined castle and the the shlangenberg
what be it
a forest no a mountain on the summit of which there be a place fence off
from it you can get a most beautiful could a chair be carry up that mountain of yours doubtless we could find bearer for the purpose i interpose
at this moment theodosia the nursemaid approach the old lady with the general s child
no i want to see them say the grandmother
i hate kiss child for their nose be always wet
how be you get on theodosia i be very well thank you madame reply the nursemaid
and how be your ladyship
we have be feel so anxious about you yes i know you simple who be those other guest the old lady continue turn again to polina
for instance who be that old rascal in the spectacle prince nilski grandmamma whisper polina
oh a russian
why i have no idea that he could understand me
surely he do not hear what i say
as for astley i have see him already and i see that he be here again
how do you do she add to the gentleman in question
astley bow in silence
have you to say to me the old lady go on
say something for goodness sake
translate to him polina do so
i have only to say replied astley gravely but also with alacrity that i be indeed glad to see you in such good this be interpret to the grandmother and she seem much gratify
how well english people know how to answer one she remark
that be why i like them so much good than french
come here she add to astley
i will try not to bore you too much
polina translate to him that i be stay in room on a low floor
yes on a low floor she repeat to astley point downwards with her finger
astley look pleased at receive the invitation
next the old lady scan polina from head to foot with minute attention
i could almost have like you prascovia suddenly she remark for you be a nice best of the lot
you have some character about you
i too have character
turn round
surely that be not false hair that you be wear no grandmamma
it be my well well
i do not like the stupid fashion of today
you be very good look
i should have fall in love with you if i have be a man
why do you not get married
it be time now that i be go
i want to walk yet i always have to ride
be you still in a bad temper she add to the general
no indeed rejoin the now mollify general
i quite understand that at your time of cette vieille est tombée en enfance de griers whisper to me
but i want to look round a little the old lady add to the general
will you lend me alexis ivanovitch for the purpose
as much as you like
but i and polina and monsieur de griers all of us hope to have the pleasure of escort mais madame cela serum un plaisir de griers comment with a bewitching smile
plaisir indeed
why i look upon you as a perfect fool then she remark to the general i be not go to let you have any of my money
i must be off to my room now to see what they be like
afterwards we will look round a little
lift me again the grandmother be borne aloft and carry down the staircase amid a perfect bevy of general walking as though he have be hit over the head with a cudgel and de griers seem to be plunge in thought
endeavour to be leave behind mlle
blanche next thought better of it and follow the rest with the prince in her wake
only the german savant and madame de cominges do not leave the general s apartment
x at probably all over landlord and manager be guide in their allotment of room to visitor not so much by the wish and requirement of those visitor as by their personal estimate of the same
it may also be say that these landlord and manager seldom make a mistake
to the grandmother however our landlord for some reason or another allot such a sumptuous suite that he fairly overreach himself for he assign her a suite consisting of four magnificently appoint room with bathroom servant quarter a separate room for her maid and so on
in fact during the previous week the suite have be occupy by no less a personage than a grand duchess which circumstance be duly explain to the new occupant as an excuse for raise the price of these apartment
the grandmother have herself rather each room in turn in order that she might subject the whole to a close and attentive scrutiny while the elderly respectfully by her side
what every one take the grandmother to be i do not know but it appear at least that she be account a person not only of great importance but also and still more of great wealth and without delay they enter her in the hotel register as madame la générale princesse de tarassevitcheva although she have never be a princess in her life
her retinue her reserved compartment in the train her pile of unnecessary trunk portmanteau and all help to increase her prestige while her wheeled chair her sharp tone and voice her eccentric question put with an air of the most overbearing and unbridled imperiousness her whole rugged and commanding as it the general awe in which she be hold
as she inspect her new abode she order her chair to be stop at interval in order that with finger extend towards some article of furniture she might ply the respectfully smile yet secretly apprehensive landlord with unexpected question
she address them to him in french although her pronunciation of the language be so bad that sometimes i have to translate them
for the most part the landlord s answer be unsatisfactory and fail to please her nor be the question themselves of a practical nature but relate generally to god know what
for instance on one occasion she halt before a picture which a poor copy of a original have a mythological subject
of whom be this a portrait she inquire
the landlord explain that it be probably that of a countess
but how know you that the old lady retort
you live here yet you can not say for certain
and why be the picture there at all
and why do its eye look so crook to all these question the landlord could return no satisfactory reply despite his floundering endeavour
the blockhead exclaim the grandmother in russian
then she proceed on her to repeat the same story in front of a saxon statuette which she have sight from afar and have command for some reason or another to be bring to her
finally she inquire of the landlord what be the value of the carpet in her bedroom as well as where the say carpet have be manufacture but the landlord could do no more than promise to make inquiry
what donkeys these people be she comment
next she turn her attention to the bed
what a huge counterpane she exclaim
turn it back the lacqueys do so
further yet further yet the old lady cry
turn it back
also take off those pillow and bolster and lift up the feather the bed be open for her inspection
mercifully it contain no bug she remark
pull off the whole thing and then put on my own pillow and sheet
the place be too luxurious for an old woman like myself
it be too large for any one person
alexis ivanovitch come and see me whenever you be not teach your after tomorrow i shall no longer be in the general s service i reply but merely living in the hotel on my own why so because the other day there arrive from berlin a german and his of some importance and it chance that when take a walk i speak to them in german without have properly compass the berlin indeed yes and this action on my part the baron hold to be an insult and complain about it to the general who yesterday dismiss me from his but i suppose you must have threaten that precious baron or something of the kind
however even if you do so it be a matter of no no i do not
the baron be the aggressor by raise his stick at upon that the grandmother turn sharply to the general
what
you permit yourself to treat your tutor thus you nincompoop and to dismiss him from his post
you be a utter blockhead
i can see that do not alarm yourself my dear mother the general reply with a lofty air in which there be also a tinge of familiarity
i be quite capable of manage my own affair
moreover alexis ivanovitch have not give you a true account of the what do you do next the old lady inquire of me
i want to challenge the baron to a duel i reply as modestly as possible but the general protest against my do and do you so protest she inquire of the general
then she turn to the landlord and question him as to whether would not have fight a duel if challenge
for she add i can see no difference between you and the baron nor can i bear that german visage of upon this the landlord bow and depart though he could not have understand the grandmother s compliment
pardon me madame the general continue with a sneer but be duel really feasible why not
all men be crow cock and that be why they quarrel
though i perceive be a man who do not even know how to carry his breeding
lift me up
potapitch see to it that you always have bearer ready
go and arrange for their hire
but we shall not require more than two for i shall need only to be carry upstairs
on the level or in the street i can be along
go and tell them that and pay them in advance so that they may show me some respect
you too potapitch be always to come with me and alexis ivanovitch be to point out to me this baron as we go along in order that i may get a squint at the precious and where be that roulette play i explain to her that the game be carry on in the salon of the casino whereupon there ensue a string of question as to whether there be many such salon whether many people play in them whether those people play a whole day at a time and whether the game be manage accord to fix rule
at length i think it best to say that the most advisable course would be for her to go and see it for herself since a mere description of it would be a difficult matter
then take me straight there she say and do you walk on in front of me alexis what mother
before you have so much as rest from your journey the general inquire with some solicitude
also for some reason which i could not divine he seem to be grow nervous and indeed the whole party be evince sign of confusion and exchange glance with one another
probably they be think that it would be a an to accompany the grandmother to the casino where very likely she would perpetrate further eccentricity and in public too
yet on their own initiative they have offer to escort her
why should i rest she retort
i be not tire for i have be sit still these past five day
let us see what your medicinal spring and water be like and where they be situate
what too about that do you call it prascovia about that mountain top yes we be go to see it very well
be there anything else for me to see here yes
quite a number of thing polina force herself to say
martha must come with me as well go on the old lady to her maid
no no mother ejaculate the general
really she can not come
they would not admit even potapitch to the rubbish
because she be my servant be that a reason for turn her out
why she be only a human be like the rest of us and as she have be travel for a week she might like to look about her
with whom else could she go out but myself
she would never dare to show her nose in the street but be you ashamed to be see with me
stop at home then and you will be ask no question
a pretty general be to be sure
i be a general s widow myself
but after all why should i drag the whole party with me
i will go and see the sight with only alexis ivanovitch as my de griers strongly insist that ought to accompany her
indeed he launch out into a perfect shower of charm phrase concern the pleasure of act as her cicerone and so forth
every one be touch with his word
mais elle est tombée en enfance he add aside to the general
seule elle fera des more than this i could not overhear but he seem to have get some plan in his mind or even to be feel a slight return of his hope
the distance to the casino be about half a verst and our route lead us through the chestnut avenue until we reach the square directly front the building
the general i could see be a trifle reassure by the fact that though our progress be distinctly eccentric in its nature it be at least correct and orderly
as a matter of fact the spectacle of a person who be unable to walk be not anything to excite surprise at a spa
yet it be clear that the general have a great fear of the casino itself for why should a person who have lose the use of her especially an old go to room which be set apart only for roulette
on either side of the wheeled chair walk polina and mlle
latter smile modestly jest and in short make herself so agreeable to the grandmother that in the end the old lady relent towards her
on the other side of the chair polina have to answer an endless flow of petty as who be it pass just now who be that come along be the town a large one be the public garden extensive what sort of tree be those what be the name of those hill do i see eagle fly yonder what be that building and so forth
meanwhile astley whisper to me as he walk by my side that he look for much to happen that morning
behind the old lady s chair march potapitch and in his frockcoat and white waistcoat with a cloak over all and the and rosy but slightly martha in a mobcap cotton dress and squeaking shoe
frequently the old lady would twist herself round to converse with these servant
as for de griers he speak as though he have make up his mind to do something though it be also possible that he speak in this manner merely in order to hearten the general with whom he appear to have hold a conference
but alas the grandmother have utter the fatal word i be not go to give you any of my money and though de griers might regard these word lightly the general know his mother better
also i notice that de griers and mlle
blanche be still exchange look while of the prince and the german savant i lose sight at the end of the avenue where they have turn back and leave us
into the casino we march in triumph
at once both in the person of the commissionaire and in the person of the footman there spring to life the same reverence as have arise in the lacqueys of the hotel
yet it be not without some curiosity that they eye us
without loss of time the grandmother give order that she should be wheel through every room in the establishment of which apartments she praise a few while to others she remain indifferent
concern everything however she ask question
finally we reach the where a lacquey who be act as guard over the door fling them open as though he be a man possess
the grandmother s entry into the produce a profound impression upon the public
around the table and at the further end of the room where the table be set out there may have be gather from to gambler range in several row
those who have succeed in push their way to the table be stand with their foot firmly plant in order to avoid have to give up their place until they should have finish their game since merely to stand look occupy a gambler s place for not permit
true chair be provide around the table but few player make use of especially if there be a large attendance of the general public since to stand allow of a close approach and therefore of great facility for calculation and staking
behind the foremost row be herd a second and a third row of people await their turn but sometimes their impatience lead these people to stretch a hand through the first row in order to deposit their stake
even individual would dart forward to stake whence seldom do more than five or ten minute pass without a scene over disputed money arise at one or another end of the table
on the other hand the police of the casino be an able body of men and though to escape the crush be an impossibility however much one might wish it the eight croupier apportion to each table keep an eye upon the stake perform the necessary reckoning and decide dispute as they arise
in the last resort they always call in the casino police and the dispute would immediately come to an end
policeman be station about the casino in ordinary costume and mingle with the spectator so as to make it impossible to recognise them
in particular they keep a lookout for pickpocket and swindler who simply swanned in the roulette salon and reap a rich harvest
indeed in every direction money be be filch from pocket or of course if the attempt miscarry a great uproar ensue
one have only to approach a roulette table begin to play and then openly grab some one else s winning for a din to be raise and the thief to start vociferate that the stake be and if the coup have be carry out with sufficient skill and the witness waver at all in their testimony the thief would as likely as not succeed in get away with the money provide that the sum be not a large large enough to have attract the attention of the croupier or some
moreover if it be a stake of insignificant size its true owner would sometimes decline to continue the dispute rather than become involved in a scandal
conversely if the thief be detect he be ignominiously expel the building
upon all this the grandmother gaze with curiosity and on some thief happen to be turn out of the place she be delighted
interested her but little she prefer roulette with its wheel
at length she express a wish to view the game closer whereupon in some mysterious manner the lacqueys and other officious agent especially one or two ruined pole of the kind who keep offer their service to successful gambler and foreigner in general at once find and clear a space for the old lady among the crush at the very centre of one of the table and next to the chief croupier after which they wheel her chair thither
upon this a number of visitor who be not play but only look on particularly some englishman with their family press closer forward towards the table in order to watch the old lady from among the rank of the gambler
many a lorgnette i saw turn in her direction and the croupier hope rise high that such an eccentric player be about to provide them with something out of the common
an old lady of year who though unable to walk desire to play be not an everyday phenomenon
i too pressed forward towards the table and range myself by the grandmother s side while martha and potapitch remain somewhere in the background among the crowd and the general polina and de griers with mlle
blanche also remain hidden among the spectator
at first the old lady do no more than watch the gambler and ply me in a with question as to who be
especially do her favour light upon a very young man who be plunge heavily and have win so it be whisper as much as franc which be lie before him on the table in a heap of gold and
his eye keep flash and his hand shake yet all the while he stake without any sort of what come to his hand as he keep win and win and rake and rake in his gain
around him lacqueys chair just behind where he be clear the spectator from his vicinity so that he should have more room and not be whole do of course in expectation of a generous largesse
from time to time other gambler would hand him part of their glad to let him stake for them as much as his hand could grasp while beside him stand a pole in a state of violent but respectful agitation who also in expectation of a generous largesse keep whisper to him at interval probably tell him what to stake and advising and direct his play
yet never once do the player throw him a glance as he stake and stake and rake in his winning
evidently the player in question be dead to all besides
for a few minute the grandmother watch him
go and tell him suddenly she exclaim with a nudge at my elbow and tell him to stop and to take his money with him and go home
presently he will be lose everything that he have now she seem almost breathless with excitement
where be potapitch she continue
send potapitch to speak to him
no must tell him must tell him she nudge me for i have not the least notion where potapitch be
sortez sortez she shout to the young man until i lean over in her direction and whisper in her ear that no shouting be allow nor even loud speaking since to do so disturb the calculation of the player and might lead to our be eject
how provoking she retort
then the young man be do for
i suppose he to be ruin
yet i could not bear to see him have to return it all
what a fool the fellow be and the old lady turn sharply away
on the left among the player at the other half of the table a young lady be play with beside her a dwarf
who the dwarf may have a relative or a person whom she take with her to act as a do not know but i have notice her there on previous occasion since everyday she enter the casino at one o clock precisely and depart at play for exactly one hour
be to the attendant she always have a seat provide for her and take some gold and a few note out of her begin quietly coldly and after much calculation to stake and mark down the figure in pencil on a paper as though strive to work out a system accord to which at give moment the odds might group themselves
always she stake large coin and either lose or win one two or three thousand franc a day but not more after which she would depart
the grandmother take a long look at her
woman be not lose she say
to whom do she belong
do you know her
who be she she be i believe a frenchwoman i reply
ah
a bird of passage evidently
besides i can see that she have her shoe polish
now explain to me the meaning of each round in the game and the way in which one ought to upon this i set myself to explain the meaning of all the rouge et noir of pair et impair of manque et passe with lastly the different value in the system of number
the grandmother listen attentively take note put question in various form and lay the whole thing to heart
indeed since an example of each system of stake keep constantly occur a great deal of information could be assimilate with ease and celerity
the grandmother be vastly pleased
but what be zero she inquire
just now i hear the croupier call out zero and why do he keep rake in all the money that be on the table
to think that he should grab the whole pile for himself
what do zero mean zero be what the bank take for itself
if the wheel stop at that figure everything lie on the table become the absolute property of the bank
also whenever the wheel have begin to turn the bank cease to pay out then i should receive nothing if i be stake no unless by any chance you have stake on zero in which case you would receive time the value of your why time when zero so often turn up
and if so why do not more of these fool stake upon it because the number of chance against its occurrence be rubbish
potapitch potapitch
come here and i will give you some the old lady take out of her pocket a purse and extract from its depth a piece
go at once and stake that upon but madame zero have only this moment turn up i remonstrate wherefore it may not do so again for ever so long
wait a little and you may then have a good rubbish
stake pardon me but zero might not turn up again until say tonight even though you have stake thousand upon it
it often happen rubbish rubbish
who fear the wolf should never enter the forest
what
we have lose
then stake a second piece do we lose and then i put down a third
the grandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair so intent be she upon the little ball as it leap through the notch of the wheel
however the third piece follow the first two
upon this the grandmother go perfectly crazy
she could no longer sit still and actually strike the table with her fist when the croupier cry out instead of the desiderated zero
to listen to him fume the old lady
when will that accurse zero ever turn up
i can not breathe until i see it
i believe that that infernal croupier be keep it from turn up
alexis ivanovitch stake two golden piece this time
the moment we cease to stake that curse zero will come turn up and we shall get my good stake stake
it be not accordingly i stake two piece
the ball go hop round the wheel until it begin to settle through the notch
meanwhile the grandmother sit as though petrified with my hand convulsively clutch in hers
zero call the croupier
there
you see you see cry the old lady as she turn and face me wreathe in smile
i tell you so
it be the lord god himself who suggest to me to stake those two coin
now how much ought i to receive
why do they not pay it out to me
potapitch
martha
where be they
what have become of our party
potapitch potapitch presently madame i whisper
potapitch be outside and they would decline to admit him to these room
see
you be be pay out your money
pray take the croupier be make up a heavy packet of coin seal in blue paper and contain fifty ten gülden piece together with an unsealed packet contain another twenty
i hand the whole to the old lady in a
faites le jeu monsieur
faites le jeu monsieur
rien ne va plus proclaim the croupier as once more he invite the company to stake and prepare to turn the wheel
we shall be too late
he be go to spin again
stake stake the grandmother be in a perfect fever
do not hang back
be quick she seem almost beside herself and nudge me as hard as she could
upon what shall i stake madame upon zero upon zero
again upon zero
stake as much as ever you can
how much have we get
seventy piece
we shall not miss them so stake twenty piece at a think a moment madame
sometimes zero do not turn up for two hundred round in succession
i assure you that you may lose all your you be wrong
stake i tell you
what a chatter tongue you have
i know perfectly well what i be the old lady be shake with excitement
but the rule do not allow of more than gülden be stake upon zero at a how do not allow
surely you be wrong
monsieur here she nudge the croupier who be sit on her left and prepare to combien zero
douze
douze i hasten to translate
oui madame be the croupier s polite reply
no single stake must exceed four thousand florin
that be the then there be nothing else for it
we must risk in le jeu est fait the croupier call
the wheel revolve and stop at thirty
we have lose
again again again
stake again shout the old lady
without attempt to oppose her further but merely shrugging my shoulder i place twelve more piece upon the table
the wheel whirl around and around with the grandmother simply quake as she watch its revolution
do she again think that zero be go to be the win coup think i as i star at her in astonishment
yet an absolute assurance of win be shin on her face she look perfectly convince that zero be about to be call again
at length the ball drop off into one of the notch
zero cry the croupier
ah
scream the old lady as she turn to me in a whirl of triumph
i myself be at heart a gambler
at that moment i become acutely conscious both of that fact and of the fact that my hand and knee be shake and that the blood be beat in my brain
of course this be a rare occasion on which zero have turn up no less than three time within a dozen round yet in such an event there be nothing so very surprising seeing that only three day ago i myself have be a witness to zero turn up time in so that one of the player who be record the coup on paper be move to remark that for several day past zero have never turn up at all
with the grandmother as with any one who have win a very large sum the management settle up with great attention and respect since she be fortunate to have to receive no less than gülden
of these gülden the odd be pay her in gold and the remainder in bank note
this time the old lady do not call for potapitch for that she be too preoccupied
though not outwardly shake by the event indeed she seem perfectly calm she be tremble inwardly from head to foot
at length completely absorb in the game she burst out alexis ivanovitch do not the croupier just say that florin be the most that could be stake at any one time
well take these and stake them upon the to oppose her be useless
once more the wheel revolve
rouge proclaim the croupier
again all
give me them command the grandmother and stake the other upon the red i do so
rouge proclaim the croupier
twelve thousand cry the old lady
hand me the whole lot
put the gold into this purse here and count the bank note
enough
let us go home
wheel my chair xi the chair with the old lady beaming in it be wheel away towards the door at the further end of the salon while our party hasten to crowd around her and to offer her their congratulation
in fact eccentric as be her conduct it be also overshadow by her triumph with the result that the general no longer fear to be publicly compromise by be see with such a strange woman but smile in a condescending cheerfully familiar way as though he be soothe a child he offer his greeting to the old lady
at the same time both he and the rest of the spectator be visibly impressed
everywhere people keep point to the grandmother and talk about her
many people even walk beside her chair in order to view her the good while at a little distance astley be carry on a conversation on the subject with two english acquaintance of his
de griers be simply overflow with smile and compliment and a number of fine lady be star at the grandmother as though she have be something curious
quelle victoire exclaim de griers
mais madame c était du feu add mlle
blanche with an elusive smile
yes i have win twelve thousand florin reply the old lady
and then there be all this gold
with it the total ought to come to nearly thirteen thousand
how much be that in russian money
six thousand rouble i think however i calculate that the sum would exceed seven thousand at the present rate of exchange even eight thousand
eight thousand rouble
what a splendid thing
and to think of you simpletons sit there and do nothing
potapitch
martha
see what i have win how you do it madame martha exclaim ecstatically
eight thousand rouble and i be go to give you fifty gülden apiece
there they potapitch and martha rushed towards her to kiss her hand
and to each bearer also i will give a piece
let them have it out of the gold alexis ivanovitch
but why be this footman bowing to me and that other man as well
be they congratulate me
well let them have ten gülden madame la pauvre prince russes sont si généreux say a man who for some time past have be hang around the old lady s personage who dress in a shabby frockcoat and colour waistcoat keep take off his cap and smile pathetically
give him ten gülden say the grandmother
no give him twenty
now enough of that or i shall never get do with you all
take a moment s rest and then carry me away
prascovia i mean to buy a new dress for you tomorrow
yes and for you too mlle
blanche
please translate merci madame reply mlle
blanche gratefully as she twist her face into the mocking smile which usually she keep only for the benefit of de griers and the general
the latter look confused and seem greatly relieve when we reach the avenue
how surprised theodosia too will be go on the grandmother thinking of the general s nursemaid
she like yourselves shall have the price of a new gown
here alexis ivanovitch
give that beggar something a ragamuffin have approach to stare at us
but perhaps he be a a rascal i reply
never mind never mind
give him a i approach the beggar in question and hand him the coin
look at me in great astonishment he silently accept the gülden while from his person there proceed a strong smell of liquor
have you never try your luck alexis ivanovitch no yet just now i could see that you be burn to do so i mean to try my luck then stake everything upon zero
you have see how it ought to be do
how much capital do you possess two hundred gülden not very much
see here i will lend you five hundred if you wish
take this purse of with that she add sharply to the general but need not expect to receive this seem to upset him but he say nothing and de griers content himself by scowl
que diable he whisper to the general
c est une terrible look
another beggar another beggar exclaim the grandmother
alexis ivanovitch go and give him a as she speak i saw approach us a old man with a wooden man who be dress in a blue frockcoat and carry a staff
he look like an old soldier
as soon as i tender him the coin he fell back a step or two and eye me threateningly
be ist der teufel he cry and append thereto a round dozen of oath
the man be a perfect fool exclaim the grandmother wave her hand
move on now for i be simply famished
when we have lunch we will return to that what cry i
you be go to play what else do you suppose she retort
be you go only to sit here and grow sour and let me look at you madame say de griers confidentially les chance peuvent tourner
une seule mauvaise chance et vous perdrez avec votre jeu
c était terrible oui vous perdrez absolument put in mlle
blanche
what have that get to do with retort the old lady
it be not money that i be go to lose it be my own
and where be that astley of yours she add to myself
he stay behind in the what a pity
he be such a nice sort of man arrive home and meet the landlord on the staircase the grandmother call him to her side and boast to him of her do the same to theodosia and confer upon her thirty gülden after which she bid her serve luncheon
the meal over theodosia and martha break into a joint flood of ecstasy
i be watch you all the time madame quaver martha and i ask potapitch what mistress be try to do
and my word
the heap and of money that be lie upon the table
never in my life have i see so much money
and there be gentlefolk around it and other gentlefolk sit down
so i ask potapitch where all these gentry have come from for thought i maybe the holy mother of god will help our mistress among them
yes i pray for you madame and my heart die within me so that i keep tremble and tremble
the lord be with her i think to myself and in answer to my prayer he have now send you what he have do
even yet i tremble to think of it alexis ivanovitch say the old lady after luncheon be to say about four o ready to go out with me again
but in the meanwhile
do not forget to call a doctor for i must take the water
now go and get rest a i leave the grandmother s presence in a state of bewilderment
vainly i endeavour to imagine what would become of our party or what turn the affair would next take
i could perceive that none of the party have yet recover their presence of of all the general
the factor of the grandmother s appearance in place of the hourly expect telegram to announce her death with of course resultant legacy have so upset the whole scheme of intention and project that it be with a decided feeling of apprehension and grow paralysis that the conspirator view any future performance of the old lady at roulette
yet this second factor be not quite so important as the first since though the grandmother have twice declare that she do not intend to give the general any money that declaration be not a complete ground for the abandonment of hope
certainly de griers who with the general be up to the neck in the affair have not wholly lose courage and i felt sure that mlle
blanche
blanche who be not only as deeply involve as the other two but also expectant of become madame general and an important not lightly surrender the position but would use her every resource of coquetry upon the old lady in order to afford a contrast to the impetuous polina who be difficult to understand and lack the art of please
yet now when the grandmother have just perform an astonishing feat at roulette now when the old lady s personality have be so clearly and typically reveal as that of a rugged arrogant woman who be tombée en enfance now when everything appear to be lose now the grandmother be as merry as a child which play with
good lord i think with may god forgive me a most malicious smile every piece which the grandmother stake must have raise a blister on the general s heart and madden de griers and drive mlle
de come almost to frenzy with the sight of this spoon dangle before her another factor be the circumstance that even when overjoy at win the grandmother be distribute alms right and left and take every one to be a beggar she again snap out to the general that he be not go to be allow any of her meant that the old lady have quite make up her mind on the point and be sure of it
yes danger loom ahead
all these thought pass through my mind during the few moment that have leave the old lady s room i be ascend to my own room on the top storey
what most strike me be the fact that though i have divine the chief the stout thread which unite the various actor in the drama i have until now be ignorant of the method and secret of the game
for polina have never be completely open with me
although on occasion it have happen that involuntarily as it be she have reveal to me something of her heart i have notice that in most fact nearly have either laugh away these revelation or grow confused or purposely impart to them a false guise
yes she must have conceal a great deal from me
but i have a presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation be approach
another stroke and all would be finish and expose
of my own fortune interested though i be in the affair i take no account
i be in the strange position of possess but two hundred gülden of be at a loose end of lack both a post the mean of subsistence a shred of hope and any plan for the future yet of care nothing for these thing
have not my mind be so full of polina i should have give myself up to the comical piquancy of the impending denouement and laugh my fill at it
but the thought of polina be torture to me
that her fate be settle i already have an inkling yet be not the thought which be give me so much uneasiness
what i really wish for be to penetrate her secret
i want her to come to me and say i love you and if she would not so come or if to hope that she would ever do so be an unthinkable then there be nothing else for me to want
even now i do not know what i be want
i feel like a man who have lose his way
i yearn but to be in her presence and within the circle of her light and be there now and forever and for the whole of my life
more i do not know
how can i ever bring myself to leave her
on reach the third storey of the hotel i experience a shock
i be just pass the general s suite when something cause me to look round
out of a door about twenty pace away there be come polina
she hesitate for a moment on see me and then beckon me to her
polina alexandrovna hush
not so something startle me just now i whisper and i look round and saw you
some electrical influence seem to emanate from your take this letter she go on with a frown probably she have not even hear my word she be so preoccupied and hand it personally to astley
go as quickly as ever you can please
no answer will be require
he she do not finish her sentence
to astley i ask in some astonishment
but she have vanish again
aha
so the two be carry on a correspondence
however i set off to search for at his hotel and then at the casino where i go the round of the salon in vain
at length vexed and almost in despair i be on my way home when i run across him among a troop of english lady and gentleman who have be out for a ride
beckon to him to stop i hand him the letter
we have barely time even to look at one another but i suspect that it be of set purpose that he restart his horse so quickly
be jealousy then gnaw at me
at all event i felt exceedingly depress despite the fact that i have no desire to ascertain what the correspondence be about
to think that should be her confidant
my friend mine own familiar friend pass through my mind
yet there any love in the matter
of course not reason whisper to me
but reason go for little on such occasion
i felt that the matter must be clear up for it be become unpleasantly complex
i have scarcely set foot in the hotel when the commissionaire and the landlord the latter issuing from his room for the purpose alike inform me that i be be search for high and three separate message to ascertain my whereabouts have come down from the general
when i enter his study i be feel anything but kindly dispose
i find there the general himself de griers and mlle
blanche but not s mother who be a person whom her reputed daughter use only for show purpose since in all matter of business the daughter fend for herself and it be unlikely that the mother know anything about them
some very heated discussion be in progress and meanwhile the door of the study be unprecedented circumstance
as i approach the portal i could hear loud voice raise for mingle with the pert venomous accent of de griers be mlle
blanche s excite impudently abusive tongue and the general s plaintive wail as apparently he seek to justify himself in something
but on my appearance every one stop speaking and try to put a good face upon matter
de griers smooth his hair and twist his angry face into a the mean studiedly polite french smile which i so detest while the downcast perplexed general assume an air of only in a mechanical way
on the other hand mlle
blanche do not trouble to conceal the wrath that be sparkle in her countenance but bend her gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy
i may remark that hitherto she have treat me with absolute superciliousness and so far from answer my salutation have always ignore them
alexis ivanovitch begin the general in a tone of affectionate upbraiding may i say to you that i find it strange exceedingly strange short your conduct towards myself and my in a word eh
ce n est pa ça interrupt de griers in a tone of impatience and contempt evidently he be the rule spirit of the conclave
mon cher monsieur notre général se trompe
what he mean to say be that he warn begs of you most to ruin him
i use the expression why
why i interject
because you have take upon yourself to act as guide to this to shall i express it this old lady à cette pauvre terrible vieille
but she will only gamble away all that she it away like thistledown
you yourself have see her play
once she have acquire the taste for gamble she will never leave the but of sheer perversity and temper will stake her all and lose it
in case such as hers a gambler can never be tear away from the game and and then asseverate the general you will have ruin my whole family
i and my family be her heir for she have no nearer relatives than ourselves
i tell you frankly that my affair be in great disorder how much they be so you yourself be partially aware
if she should lose a large sum or maybe her whole fortune what will become of my child here the general exchange a glance with de griers or of me here he look at mlle
blanche who turn her head contemptuously away
alexis ivanovitch i beg of you to save tell me general how be i to do so
on what foot do i stand here refuse to take her about
simply leave her but she would soon find some one else to take my place ce n est pa ça ce n est pa ça again interrupt de griers
que diable
do not leave her alone so much as advise her persuade her draw her away
in any case do not let her gamble find her some and how be i to do that
if only you would undertake the task monsieur de griers i say this last as innocently as possible but at once saw a rapid glance of excited interrogation pas from mlle
blanche to de griers while in the face of the latter also there gleam something which he could not repress
well at the present moment she would refuse to accept my service say he with a gesture
but if here he give mlle
blanche another glance which be full of mean whereupon she advance towards me with a bewitching smile and seize and press my hand
devil take it but how that devilish visage of hers could change
at the present moment it be a visage full of supplication and as gentle in its expression as that of a smile roguish infant
stealthily she draw me apart from the rest as though the more completely to separate me from them and though no harm come of her do it be merely a stupid manoeuvre and no find the situation very unpleasant
the general hasten to lend her his support
alexis ivanovitch he begin pray pardon me for have say what i do just have say more than i mean to do
i beg and beseech you i kiss the hem of your garment as our russian saying have it for you and only you can save us
i and mlle
de cominges we all of us beg of you understand do you not
surely you understand and with his eye he indicate mlle
blanche
truly he be cut a pitiful figure
at this moment three low respectful knock sound at the door which on be open reveal a chambermaid with potapitch behind from the grandmother to request that i should attend her in her room
she be in a bad humour add potapitch
the time be three
my mistress be unable to sleep explained potapitch so after toss about for a while she suddenly rise call for her chair and send me to look for you
she be now in the quelle mégère exclaim de griers
true enough i find madame in the hotel put about at my delay for she have be unable to contain herself until four o clock
lift me up she cry to the bearer and once more we set out for the
xii the grandmother be in an impatient irritable frame of mind
without doubt the roulette have turn her head for she appear to be indifferent to everything else and in general seem much distraught
for instance she ask me no question about object except that when a sumptuous barouche pass us and raise a cloud of dust she lift her hand for a moment and inquire what be that yet even then she do not appear to hear my reply although at time her abstraction be interrupt by sally and fit of sharp impatient fidgeting
again when i point out to her the baron and baroness burmergelm walk to the casino she merely look at them in an sort of way and say with complete indifference ah then turn sharply to potapitch and martha who be walk behind us she rap out why have attach yourselves to the party
we be not go to take you with us every time
go home at then when the servant have pull hasty bow and depart she add to me you be all the escort i at the casino the grandmother seem to be expect for no time be lose in procure her former place beside the croupier
it be my opinion that though croupier seem such ordinary humdrum who care nothing whether the bank win or be in reality anything but indifferent to the bank s losing and be give instruction to attract player and to keep a watch over the bank s interest as also that for such service these official be award prize and premium
at all event the croupier of roulettenberg seem to look upon the grandmother as their lawful there befall what our party have foretell
it happen thus as soon as ever we arrive the grandmother order me to stake twelve piece in succession upon zero
once twice and thrice i do so yet zero never turn up
stake again say the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow and i obey
how many time have we lose she grind her teeth in her excitement
we have lose piece i reply
i tell you madame that zero may not turn up until never mind she interrupt
keep on stake upon zero and also stake a thousand gülden upon rouge
here be a banknote with which to do the red turn up but zero miss again and we only get our thousand gülden back
but you see you see whisper the old lady
we have now recover almost all that we stake
try zero again
let us do so another ten time and then leave by the fifth round however the grandmother be weary of the scheme
to the devil with that zero she exclaim
stake four thousand gülden upon the but madame that will be so much to venture i remonstrate
suppose the red should not turn up the grandmother almost strike me in her excitement
her agitation be rapidly make her quarrelsome
consequently there be nothing for it but to stake the whole four thousand gülden as she have direct
the wheel revolve while the grandmother sit as bolt upright and with as proud and quiet a mien as though she have not the least doubt of win
zero cry the croupier
at first the old lady fail to understand the situation but as soon as she saw the croupier raking in her four thousand gülden together with everything else that happen to be lie on the table and recognise that the zero which have be so long turn up and on which we have lose nearly two hundred piece have at length as though of set purpose make a sudden the poor old lady fell to curse it and to throw herself about and wail and gesticulate at the company at large
indeed some people in our vicinity actually burst out laugh
to think that that accurse zero should have turn up she sob
the accursed accursed thing
and it be all fault she add round upon me in a frenzy
it be who persuade me to cease stake upon but madame i only explain the game to you
how be to answer for every mischance which may occur in it you and your mischance she whisper threateningly
go
away at once farewell then and i turn to depart
she put in hastily
where be you go to
why should you leave me
you fool
no no stay here
it be who be the fool
tell me what i ought to i can not take it upon myself to advise you for you will only blame me if i do so
play at your own discretion
say exactly what you wish stake and i will stake very well
stake another four thousand gülden upon the red
take this banknote to do it with
i have still get twenty thousand rouble in actual but i whisper such a quantity of never mind
i can not rest until i have win back my loss
stake i stake and we lose
stake again stake thousand at a stroke i can not madame
the large stake allow be four thousand well then stake four this time we win and the grandmother recover herself a little
you see you see she exclaim as she nudge me
stake another four i do so and lose
again and yet again we lose
madame your twelve thousand gülden be now go at length i report
i see they be she reply with as it be the calmness of despair
i see they be she mutter again as she gaze straight in front of her like a person lose in thought
ah well i do not mean to rest until i have stake another four but you have no money with which to do it madame
in this satchel i can see only a few five percent bond and some actual and in the purse a mere but there be a s office here be there not
they tell me i should be able to get any sort of paper security change quite so to any amount you please
but you will lose on the transaction what would frighten even a rubbish
i be to retrieve my loss
take me away and call those fool of i wheel the chair out of the throng and the bearer make their appearance we leave the casino
hurry hurry command the grandmother
show me the near way to the s
be it far a couple of step at the turn from the square into the avenue we come face to face with the whole of our general de griers mlle
blanche and her mother
only polina and astley be absent
well well well exclaim the grandmother
but we have no time to stop
what do you want
i can t talk to you i drop behind a little and immediately be pounce upon by de griers
she have lose this morning s winning i whisper and also twelve thousand gülden of her original money
at the present moment we be go to get some bond de griers stamp his foot with vexation and hasten to communicate the tidings to the general
meanwhile we continue to wheel the old lady along
stop her stop her whisper the general in consternation
you have good try and stop her yourself i in a whisper
my good mother he say as he approach her good mother pray let his voice be begin to tremble and sink us hire a carriage and go for a drive
near here there be an enchant view to be obtain
be just come to invite you to go and see begone with you and your view say the grandmother angrily as she wave him away
and there be tree there and we could have tea under them continue the in utter despair
nous boirons du lait sur l herbe fraiche add de griers with the snarl almost of a wild beast
du lait de l herbe fraiche idyll the ideal of the parisian whole outlook upon la nature et la verité
have do with you and your milk cry the old lady
go and stuff as much as you like but my stomach simply recoil from the idea
what be you stop for
i have nothing to say to here we be madame i announce
here be the moneychanger s i enter to get the security change while the grandmother remain outside in the porch and the rest wait at a little distance in doubt as to their best course of action
at length the old lady turn such an angry stare upon them that they depart along the road towards the casino
the process of change involve complicated calculation which soon necessitate my return to the grandmother for instruction
the thief she exclaim as she clap her hand together
never mind though
get the document send the banker out to me she add as an afterthought
would one of the clerk do madame yes one of the clerk
the thief the clerk consent to come out when he perceive that he be be ask for by an old lady who be too infirm to walk after which the grandmother begin to upbraid him at length and with great vehemence for his alleged usuriousness and to bargain with him in a mixture of russian french and act as interpreter
meanwhile the official eye us both and silently nod his head
at the grandmother in particular he gaze with a curiosity which almost border upon rudeness
at length too he smile
pray recollect yourself cry the old lady
and may my money choke you
alexis ivanovitch tell him that we can easily repair to someone the clerk say that others will give you even less than of what the ultimate calculation consist i do not exactly remember but at all event they be alarm
receive twelve thousand florin in gold i take also the statement of account and carry it out to the grandmother
well well she say i be no accountant
let us hurry away hurry and she wave the paper aside
neither upon that accurse zero however nor upon that equally accurse red do i mean to stake a cent i mutter to myself as i enter the casino
this time i do all i could to persuade the old lady to stake as little as that a turn would come in the chance when she would be at liberty to stake more
but she be so impatient that though at first she agree to do as i suggest nothing could stop her when once she have begin
by way of prelude she win stake of a hundred and two hundred gülden
there you be she say as she nudge me
see what we have win
surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a hundred for we might win another four thousand and
oh it be your fault your fault i felt greatly put out as i watch her play but i decide to hold my tongue and to give her no more advice
suddenly de griers appear on the scene
it seem that all this while he and his companion have be stand beside i notice that mlle
blanche have withdraw a little from the rest and be engage in flirt with the prince
clearly the general be greatly put out at this
indeed he be in a perfect agony of vexation
but mlle
be careful never to look his way though he do his best to attract her notice
poor general
by turn his face blanch and redden and he be tremble to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old lady s play
at length mlle
and the prince take their departure and the general follow them
madame madame sound the honeyed accent of de griers as he lean over to whisper in the grandmother s ear
that stake will never win
no no it be impossible he add in russian with a writhe
no no but why not ask the grandmother turn round
show me what i ought to instantly de griers burst into a babble of french as he advise jump about declare that such and such chance ought to be wait for and start to make calculation of figure
all this he address to me in my capacity as the table the while with his finger and point hither and thither
at length he seize a pencil and begin to reckon sum on paper until he have exhaust the grandmother s patience
away with you she interrupt
you talk sheer nonsense for though you keep on say madame madame you haven t the least notion what ought to be do
away with you i say mais madame cooed de straightway start afresh with his fussy instruction
stake just as he advise the grandmother say to me and then we shall see what we see
of course his stake as a matter of fact de grier s one object be to distract the old lady from stake large sum wherefore he now suggest to her that she should stake upon certain number singly and in group
consequently in accordance with his instruction i stake a piece upon several odd number in the first twenty and five piece upon certain group of of from twelve to eighteen and from eighteen to
the total stake amount to gülden
the wheel revolve
zero cry the croupier
we have lose it all
the fool cry the old lady as she turn upon de griers
you infernal frenchman to think that should advise
away with you
though you fuss and fuss you don t even know what you re talk deeply offend de griers shrug his shoulder favour the grandmother with a look of contempt and depart
for some time past he have be feel ashamed of be see in such company and this have prove the last straw
an hour later we have lose everything in hand
home cry the grandmother
not until we have turn into the avenue do she utter a word but from that point onwards until we arrive at the hotel she keep vent exclamation of what a fool i be
what a silly old fool i be to be sure arrive at the hotel she call for tea and then give order for her luggage to be pack
we be off again she announce
but whither madame inquire martha
what business be that of let the cricket stick to its hearth
potapitch have everything pack for we be return to moscow at once
i have fool away fifteen thousand the russian form of mind your own fifteen thousand rouble good mistress
my god and potapitch spat upon his to show that he be ready to serve her in any way he could
now then you fool
at once you begin with your weeping and wailing
be quiet and pack
also run downstairs and get my hotel the next train leaf at madame i interpose with a view to check her agitation
and what be the time now how vexing
but never mind
alexis ivanovitch i have not a kopeck leave i have but these two bank note
please run to the office and get them change
otherwise i shall have nothing to travel depart on her errand i return half an hour later to find the whole party gather in her room
it appear that the news of her impending departure for moscow have throw the conspirator into consternation even great than her loss have do
for say they even if her departure should save her fortune what will become of the general later
and who be to repay de griers
clearly mlle
blanche would never consent to wait until the grandmother be dead but would at once elope with the prince or someone else
so they have all gather to calm and dissuade the grandmother
only polina be absent
for her part the grandmother have nothing for the party but abuse
away with you you rascals she be shout
what have my affair to do with you
why in particular do she indicate de come sneak here with your goat s beard
and what do she turn to mlle
blanche want of me
what be finicking for diantre mutter mlle
under her breath but her eye be flash
then all at once she burst into a laugh and leave the to the general as she do so elle vivra cent an so you have be count upon my death have you fume the old lady
away with you
clear them out of the room alexis ivanovitch
what business be it of it be not money that i have be squander but my the general shrug his shoulder bow and withdraw with de griers behind him
call prascovia command the grandmother and in five minute martha reappear with polina who have be sit with the child in her own room have purposely determine not to leave it that day
her face look grave and careworn
prascovia begin the grandmother be what i have just hear through a side wind that this fool of a stepfather of yours be go to marry that silly whirligig of a actress or something bad
tell me be it true i do not know grandmamma replied polina but from mlle
blanche s account for she do not appear to think it necessary to conceal anything i conclude you need not say any more interrupted the grandmother energetically
i understand the situation
i always think we should get something like this from him for i always look upon him as a futile frivolous fellow who give himself unconscionable air on the fact of his be a general though he only become one because he retire as a colonel
yes i know about the sending of the telegram to inquire whether the old woman be likely to turn up her toe ah they be look for the legacy
without money that wretched woman what be her name de cominges would never dream of accept the general and his false not even for him to be her she herself they say possess a pile of money and lend it on interest and make a good thing out of it
however it be not prascovia that i be blame it be not who send those telegram
nor for that matter do i wish to recall old score
true i know that you be a vixen by you be a wasp which will sting one if one touch my heart be sore for you for i love your mother katerina
now will you leave everything here and come away with me
otherwise i do not know what be to become of you and it be not right that you should continue live with these people
nay she interpose the moment that polina attempt to speak i have not yet finish
i ask of you nothing in return
my house in moscow be as you know large enough for a palace and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you like and keep away from me for week together
will you come with me or will you not first of all let me ask of replied polina whether you be intend to depart at once what
you suppose me to be jest
i have say that i be go and i go
today i have squander fifteen thousand rouble at that accurse roulette of yours and though five year ago i promise the people of a certain suburb of moscow to build them a stone church in place of a wooden one i have be fool away my money here
however i be go back now to build my but what about the water grandmamma
surely you come here to take the water you and your water
do not anger me prascovia
surely you be try to
say then will you or will you not come with me grandmamma polina reply with deep feeling i be very very grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offer me
also to a certain extent you have guess my position aright and i be behold to you to such an extent that it may be that i come and live with you and that very soon yet there be important reason i can not make up my mind just yet
if you would let me have say a couple of week to decide you mean that you be come i mean only that i can not come just yet
at all event i could not well leave my little brother and sister here since i be to leave would be abandon altogether
but if grandmamma you would take the little one myself then of course i could come with you and would do all i could to serve you this she say with great earnestness
only without the little one i do not make a fuss as a matter of fact polina never at any time either fuss or weep
the great can find for all his chick a place
you be not come without the child
but see here prascovia
i wish you well and nothing but well yet i have divine the reason why you will not come
yes i know all prascovia
that frenchman will never bring you good of any translated great poulterer
polina colour hotly and even i start
for thought i to myself every one seem to know about that affair
or perhaps i be the only one who do not know about it now now
do not frown continue the grandmother
but i do not intend to slur thing over
you will take care that no harm befall you will you not
for you be a girl of sense and i be sorry for regard you in a different light to the rest of them
and now please leave me
but let me stay with you a little long say polina
no reply the other you need not
do not bother me for you and all of them have tire me yet when polina try to kiss the grandmother s hand the old lady withdraw it and herself kiss the girl on the cheek
as she pass me polina give me a momentary glance and then as swiftly avert her eye
and to you also alexis ivanovitch
the train start in an hour s time and i think that you must be weary of me
take these five hundred gülden for i thank you humbly madame but i be ashamed come come cry the grandmother so energetically and with such an air of menace that i do not dare refuse the money further
if when in moscow you have no place where you can lay your head she add come and see me and i will give you a recommendation
now potapitch get thing i ascend to my room and lay down upon the bed
a whole hour i must have lie thus with my head rest upon my hand
so the crisis have come
i need time for its consideration
i would have a talk with polina
ah
the frenchman
so it be true
but how could it be so
polina and de griers
what a combination
no it be too improbable
suddenly i leap up with the idea of seek astley and force him to speak
there could be no doubt that he know more than i do
astley
well he be another problem for me to solve
suddenly there come a knock at the door and i open it to find potapitch await me
sir he say my mistress be ask for indeed
but she be just departing be she not
the train leave in ten minute she be uneasy sir she can not rest
come quickly sir do not i run downstairs at once
the grandmother be just be carry out of her room into the corridor
in her hand she hold a roll of
alexis ivanovitch she cry walk on ahead and we will set out but whither madame i can not rest until i have retrieve my loss
march on ahead and ask me no question
play continue until midnight do it not for a moment i stand deep in thought but it be not long before i have make up my mind
with your leave madame i say i will not go with and why not
what do you mean
be every one here a stupid pardon me but i have nothing to reproach myself with
i merely will not go
i merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play
i also beg to return you your five hundred gülden
lay the money upon a little table which the grandmother s chair happen to be pass i bow and withdraw
what folly the grandmother shout after me
very well then
do not come and i will find my way alone
potapitch you must come with me
lift up the chair and carry me i fail to find astley and return home
it be now grow be past midnight but i subsequently learn from potapitch how the grandmother s day have end
she have lose all the money which earlier in the day i have got for her paper sum amount to about ten thousand rouble
this she do under the direction of the pole whom that afternoon she have dower with two piece
but before his arrival on the scene she have command potapitch to stake for her until at length she have tell him also to go about his business
upon that the pole have leap into the breach
not only do it happen that he know the russian language but also he could speak a mixture of three different dialect so that the pair be able to understand one another
yet the old lady never cease to abuse him despite his deferential manner and to compare him unfavourably with myself so at all event potapitch declare
the old chamberlain say to me treat her as a gentleman should but rob her right and leave as i could see with my own eye
twice she catch him at it and rat him soundly
on one occasion she even pull his hair so that the bystander burst out laugh
yet she lose everything be to say she lose all that you have change for her
then we bring her home and after ask for some water and say her prayer she go to bed
so worn out be she that she fell asleep at once
may god send her dream of angel
and be all that foreign travel have do for us
oh my own moscow
for what have we not at home there in moscow
such a garden and flower as you could never see here and fresh air and come into blossom a beautiful view to look upon
ah but what must she do but go travel abroad
alack alack xiii almost a month have pass since i last touch these which i begin under the influence of impression at once poignant and disorder
the crisis which i then felt to be approach have now arrive but in a form a hundred time more extensive and unexpected than i have look for
to me it all seem strange uncouth and tragic
certain occurrence have befall me which border upon the marvellous
at all event that be how i view them
i view them so in one regard at least
i refer to the whirlpool of event in which at the time i be revolve
but the most curious feature of all be my relation to those event for hitherto i have never clearly understood myself
yet now the actual crisis have pass away like a dream
even my passion for polina be dead
it ever so strong and genuine as i think
if so what have become of it now
at time i fancy that i must be mad that somewhere i be sit in a madhouse that these event have merely to happen that still they merely to be happen
i have be arrange and my note perhaps for the purpose of convince myself that i be not in a madhouse
at present i be lonely and alone
autumn be it be mellow the leaf and as i sit brood in this melancholy little town and how melancholy the little town of germany can be
i find myself take no thought for the future but live under the influence of pass mood and of my recollection of the tempest which recently draw me into its vortex and then cast me out again
at time i seem still to be catch within that vortex
at time the tempest seem once more to be gather and as it pass overhead to be wrap me in its fold until i have lose my sense of order and reality and continue whirl and whirl and whirl around
yet it may be that i shall be able to stop myself from revolve if once i can succeed in render myself an exact account of what have happen within the month just past
somehow i feel draw towards the pen on many and many an evening i have have nothing else in the world to do
but curiously enough of late i have take to amuse myself with the work of paul de kock which i read in german translation obtain from a wretched local library
these work i can not abide yet i read them and find myself marvel that i should be do so
somehow i seem to be afraid of any of permit any preoccupation to break the spell of the passing moment
so dear to me be the formless dream of which i have speak so dear to me be the impression which it have leave behind it that i fear to touch the vision with anything new lest it should dissolve in smoke
but be it so dear to me
yes it dear to me and will ever be fresh in my forty year hence
so let me write of it but only partially and in a more abridged form than my full impression might warrant
first of all let me conclude the history of the grandmother
next day she lose every gülden that she possess
thing be bind to happen so for person of her type who have once enter upon that road descend it with rapidity even as a sledge descend a
all day until eight o clock that even do she play and though i personally do not witness her exploit i learnt of them later through report
all that day potapitch remain in attendance upon her but the pole who direct her play she change more than once
as a beginning she dismiss her pole of the previous pole whose hair she have take to herself another one but the latter prove bad even than the former and incurred dismissal in favour of the first pole who during the time of his unemployment have nevertheless hover around the grandmother s chair and from time to time obtrude his head over her shoulder
at length the old lady become desperate for the second pole when dismiss imitate his predecessor by decline to go away with the result that one pole remain stand on the right of the victim and the other on her left from which vantage point the pair quarrel abused each other concern the stake and round and exchange the epithet laidak and other polish term of endearment
finally they effect a mutual reconciliation and toss the money about anyhow play simply at random
once more quarrelling each of them stake money on his own side of the grandmother s chair for instance the one pole stake upon the red and the other one upon the black until they have so confused and browbeat the old lady that nearly weep she be force to appeal to the head croupier for protection and to have the two pole expel
no time be lose in this be do despite the rascal cry and protestation that the old lady be in their debt that she have cheat them and that her general behaviour have be mean and dishonourable
the same even the unfortunate potapitch relate the story to me with tear complain that the two men have fill their pocket with money he himself have see them do it which have be shamelessly pilfer from his mistress
for instance one pole demand of the grandmother fifty gülden for his trouble and then stake the money by the side of her stake
she happen to win whereupon he cry out that the win stake be his and hers the loser
as soon as the two pole have be expel potapitch leave the room and report to the authority that the men s pocket be full of gold and on the grandmother also request the head croupier to look into the affair the police make their appearance and despite the protest of the pole who indeed have be catch redhanded their pocket be turn inside out and the content hand over to the grandmother
in fact in view of the circumstance that she lose all day the croupier and other authority of the casino show her every attention and on her fame spread through the town visitor of every the most knowing of them the most to get a glimpse of la vieille comtesse russe tombée en enfance who have lose so many rascal yet with the money which the authority restore to her from the pocket of the pole the grandmother effect very very little for there soon arrive to take his countryman s place a third man who could speak russian fluently be dress like a gentleman albeit in lacqueyish fashion and sport a huge moustache
though polite enough to the old lady he take a high hand with the bystander
in short he offer himself less as a servant than as an
after each round he would turn to the old lady and swear terrible oath to the effect that he be a polish gentleman of honour who would scorn to take a kopeck of her money and though he repeat these oath so often that at length she grow alarm he have her play in hand and begin to win on her behalf wherefore she felt that she could not well get rid of him
an hour later the two pole who earlier in the day have be expel from the casino make a reappearance behind the old lady s chair and renew their offer of if it be only to be send on message but from potapitch i subsequently have it that between these rascal and the say gentleman of honour there pass a wink as well as that the latter put something into their hand
next since the grandmother have not yet have scarcely for a moment leave her of the two pole run to the restaurant of the casino and bring her thence a cup of soup and afterwards some tea
in fact the pole hasten to perform this office
finally towards the close of the day when it be clear that the grandmother be about to play her last there could be see stand behind her chair no few than six native of who as yet have be neither audible nor visible and as soon as ever the old lady play the note in question they take no further notice of her but push their way past her chair to the table seize the money and stake and dispute the while and argue with the gentleman of honour who also have forget the grandmother s existence as though he be their equal
even when the grandmother have lose her all and be return about eight o clock to the hotel some three or four pole could not bring themselves to leave her but go on run beside her chair and volubly protest that the grandmother have cheat them and that she ought to be make to surrender what be not her own
thus the party arrive at the hotel whence presently the gang of rascal be eject neck and crop
accord to potapitch s calculation the grandmother lose that day a total of ninety thousand rouble in addition to the money which she have lose the day before
every paper security which she have bring with percent bond internal loan scrip and what have change into cash
also i could not but marvel at the way in which for seven or eight hour at a stretch she sit in that chair of hers almost never leave the table
again potapitch tell me that there be three occasion on which she really begin to win but that lead on by false hope she be unable to tear herself away at the right moment
every gambler know how a person may sit a day and a night at card without ever cast a glance to right or to leave
meanwhile that day some other very important event be pass in our hotel
as early as eleven o be to say before the grandmother have quit her general and de griers decide upon their last stroke
in other word on learn that the old lady have change her mind about depart and be bend on set out for the casino again the whole of our gang polina only except proceed en masse to her room for the purpose of finally and frankly treat with her
but the general quaking and greatly apprehensive as to his possible future overdid thing
after half an hour s prayer and entreaty couple with a full confession of his debt and even of his passion for mlle
blanche yes he have quite lose his head he suddenly adopt a tone of menace and start to rage at the old that she be sully the family honour that she be make a public scandal of herself and that she be smirch the fair name of russia
the upshot be that the grandmother turn him out of the room with her stick it be a real stick too
later in the morning he hold several consultation with de question which occupy him be be it in any way possible to make use of the tell them that this respect but unfortunate old lady have go out of her mind and be squander her last kopeck or something of the kind
in short be it in any way possible to engineer a specie of supervision over or of restraint upon the old lady
de griers however shrug his shoulder at this and laugh in the general s face while the old warrior go on chatter volubly and run up and down his study
finally de griers wave his hand and disappear from view and by even it become known that he have leave the hotel after hold a very secret and important conference with mlle
blanche
as for the latter from early morning she have take decisive measure by completely exclude the general from her presence and bestow upon him not a glance
indeed even when the general pursue her to the casino and meet her walking arm in arm with the prince he the general received from her and her mother not the slight recognition
nor do the prince himself bow
the rest of the day mlle
spent in probe the prince and try to make him declare himself but in this she make a woeful mistake
the little incident occur in the evening
suddenly mlle
blanche realise that the prince have not even a copper to his name but on the contrary be mind to borrow of her money wherewith to play at roulette
in high displeasure she drive him from her presence and shut herself up in her room
the same morning i go to rather to look
astley but be unsuccessful in my quest
neither in his room nor in the casino nor in the park be he to be find nor do he that day lunch at his hotel as usual
however at about five o clock i catch sight of him walk from the railway station to the hôtel d angleterre
he seem to be in a great hurry and much preoccupy though in his face i could discern no actual trace of worry or perturbation
he hold out to me a friendly hand with his usual ejaculation of ah but do not check his stride
i turn and walk beside him but find somehow that his answer forbid any put of definite question
moreover i felt reluctant to speak to him of polina nor for his part do he ask me any question concern her although on my tell him of the grandmother s exploit he listen attentively and gravely and then shrug his shoulder
she be gamble away everything that she have i remark
indeed
she arrive at the casino even before i have take my departure by train so i know she have be play
if i should have time i will go to the casino and take a look at her
the thing interest where have you be today i at myself for have as yet omit to put to him that question
to on business on what more be there to be ask after that
i accompany him until as we draw level with the hotel des quatre saisons he suddenly nod to me and disappear
for myself i return home and come to the conclusion that even have i meet him at two o clock in the afternoon i should have learnt no more from him than i have do at five o clock for the reason that i have no definite question to ask
it be bind to have be so
for me to formulate the query which i really wish to put be a simple impossibility
polina spend the whole of that day either in walk about the park with the nurse and child or in sit in her own room
for a long while past she have avoid the general and have scarcely have a word to say to him scarcely a word i mean on any topic
yes that i have notice
still even though i be aware of the position in which the general be place it have never occur to me that he would have any reason to avoid or to trouble her with family explanation
indeed when i be return to the hotel after my conversation with astley and chance to meet polina and the child i could see that her face be as calm as though the family disturbance have never touch her
to my salute she respond with a slight bow and i retire to my room in a very bad humour
of course since the affair with the burmergelms i have exchange not a word with polina nor have with her any kind of intercourse
yet i have be at my wit end for as time go on there be arise in me an dissatisfaction
even if she do not love me she ought not to have trample upon my feeling nor to have accept my confession with such contempt seeing that she must have be aware that i love her of her own accord she have allow me to tell her as much
of course the situation between us have arise in a curious manner
about two month ago i have notice that she have a desire to make me her friend her she be make trial of me for the purpose but for some reason or another the desire result have never come about and we have fall into the present strange relation which have lead me to address her as i have do
at the same time if my love be distasteful to her why have she not me to speak of it to her
but she have not so forbidden me
on the contrary there have be occasion when she have even me to speak
of course this might have be do out of sheer wantonness for i well have remark it only too after listen to what i have to say and anger me almost beyond endurance she love suddenly to torture me with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness
yet she must have know that i could not live without her
three day have elapse since the affair with the baron and i could bear the severance no longer
when that afternoon i meet her near the casino my heart almost make me faint it beat so violently
she too could not live without me for have she not say that she have of me
or have that too be speak in jest
that she have a secret of some kind there could be no doubt
what she have say to the grandmother have stab me to the heart
on a thousand occasion i have challenge her to be open with me nor could she have be ignorant that i be ready to give my very life for her
yet always she have keep me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers or else she have demand of me in lieu of the life which i offer to lay at her foot such escapade as i have perpetrate with the baron
ah be it not torture to me all this
for could it be that her whole world be bind up with the frenchman
what too about astley
the affair be inexplicable throughout
my god what distress it cause me
arrive home i in a fit of frenzy indite the following polina alexandrovna i can see that there be approach us an exposure which will involve you too
for the last time i ask of you or have you not any need of my life
if you have then make such disposition as you wish and i shall always be discoverable in my room if require
if you have need of my life write or send for i seal the letter and dispatch it by the hand of a corridor lacquey with order to hand it to the addressee in person
though i expect no answer scarcely three minute have elapse before the lacquey return with the compliment of a certain next about seven o clock i be send for by the general
i find him in his study apparently prepare to go out again for his hat and stick be lie on the sofa
when i enter he be stand in the middle of the foot wide apart and his head bend down
also he appear to be talk to himself
but as soon as ever he saw me at the door he come towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily i retreat a step and be for leave the room whereupon he seize me by both hand and draw me towards the sofa and seating himself thereon he force me to sit down on a chair opposite him
then without let go of my hand he exclaim with quiver lip and a sparkle of tear on his eyelash oh alexis ivanovitch
save me save me
have some mercy upon me for a long time i could not make out what he mean although he keep talk and talk and constantly repeat to himself have mercy mercy at length however i divine that he be expect me to give him something in the nature of rather that desert by every one and overwhelm with grief and apprehension he have bethink himself of my existence and sent for me to relieve his feeling by talk and talk and talk
in fact he be in such a confused and despondent state of mind that clasp his hand together he actually go down upon his knee and beg me to go to mlle
blanche and beseech and advise her to return to him and to accept him in marriage
but general i exclaim possibly mlle
blanche have scarcely even remark my existence
what could do with her it be in vain that i protest for he could understand nothing that be say to him next he start talk about the grandmother but always in a disconnected sort of one thought be to send for the police
in russia say he suddenly boil over with indignation or in any state where there exist a government old woman like my mother be place under proper guardianship
yes my good sir he go on relapse into a scold tone as he leap to his foot and start to pace the room do you not know this he seem to be address some imaginary auditor in the corner you not know this that in russia old woman like her be subject to restraint the devil take them again he throw himself down upon the sofa
a minute later though sobbing and almost breathless he manage to gasp out that mlle
blanche have refuse to marry him for the reason that the grandmother have turn up in place of a telegram and it be therefore clear that he have no inheritance to look for
evidently he suppose that i have hitherto be in entire ignorance of all this
again when i refer to de griers the general make a gesture of despair
he have go away he say and everything which i posse be mortgage to him
i stand strip to my skin
even of the money which you bring me from paris i know not if seven hundred franc be leave
of course that sum will do to go on with but as regard the future i know nothing i know then how will you pay your hotel bill i cry in consternation
and what shall you do afterwards he look at me vaguely but it be clear that he have not have not even question
then i try to get him to speak of polina and the child but he only return brief answer of yes yes and again start to maunder about the prince and the likelihood of the latter marrying mlle
blanche
what on earth be i to do he conclude
what on earth be i to do
be this not ingratitude
be it not sheer ingratitude and he burst into tear
nothing could be do with such a man
yet to leave him alone be dangerous for something might happen to him
i withdraw from his room for a little while but warn the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him as well as exchange a word with the corridor lacquey a very talkative fellow who likewise promise to remain on the
hardly have i leave the general when potapitch approach me with a summons from the grandmother
it be now eight o clock and she have return from the casino after finally lose all that she possess
i find her sitting in her distressed and evidently fatigue
presently martha bring her up a cup of tea and force her to drink it yet even then i could detect in the old lady s tone and manner a great change
good evening alexis ivanovitch she say slowly with her head drooping
pardon me for disturb you again
yes you must pardon an old old woman like myself for i have leave behind me all that i a hundred thousand rouble
you do quite right in decline to come with me this evening
now i be without a single groat
but i must not delay a moment i must leave by the train
i have send for that english friend of yours and be go to beg of him three thousand franc for a week
please try and persuade him to think nothing of it nor yet to refuse me for i be still a rich woman who possess three village and a couple of mansion
yes the money shall be find for i have not yet squander
i tell you this in order that he may have no doubt but here he be
clearly he be a good true enough astley have come on receive the grandmother s appeal
scarcely stop even to reflect and with scarcely a word he count out the three thousand franc under a note of hand which she duly sign
then his business do he bow and lose no time in take his departure
you too leave me alexis ivanovitch say the grandmother
all my bone be ache and i still have an hour in which to rest
do not be hard upon me old fool that i be
never again shall i blame young people for be frivolous
i should think it wrong even to blame that unhappy general of yours
nevertheless i do not mean to let him have any of my money which be all that he desire for the reason that i look upon him as a perfect blockhead and consider myself simpleton though i be at least wise than be
how surely do god visit old age and punish it for its presumption
well
martha come and lift me however i have a mind to see the old lady off and moreover i be in an expectant frame of i keep think that be go to happen wherefore i could not rest quietly in my room but step out into the corridor and then into the chestnut avenue for a few minute stroll
my letter to polina have be clear and firm and in the present crisis i felt sure would prove final
i have hear of de griers departure and however much polina might reject me as a she might not reject me altogether as a
she would need me to fetch and carry for her and i be ready to do so
how could it have be otherwise
towards the hour of the train s departure i hasten to the station and put the grandmother into her and her party occupy a reserve family saloon
thanks for your disinterested assistance she say at part
oh and please remind prascovia of what i say to her last night
i expect soon to see then i return home
as i be pass the door of the general s suite i meet the nursemaid and inquired after her master
there be nothing new to report sir she reply quietly
nevertheless i decide to enter and be just do so when i halt thunderstruck on the threshold
for before me i behold the general and mlle
gaily at one another beside them on the sofa there be seat her mother
clearly the general be almost out of his mind with joy for he be talk all sort of nonsense and bubbling over with a nervous laugh which twist his face into innumerable wrinkle and cause his eye almost to disappear
afterwards i learn from mlle
blanche herself that after dismiss the prince and hearing of the general s tear she bethink her of go to comfort the old man and have just arrive for the purpose when i enter
fortunately the poor general do not know that his fate have be mlle
have long ago pack her trunk in readiness for the first morning train to paris
hesitate a moment on the threshold i change my mind as to enter and depart unnoticed
ascend to my own room and open the door i perceive in the a figure seat on a chair in the corner by the window
the figure do not rise when i enter so i approach it swiftly peer at it closely and felt my heart almost stop beating
the figure be polina
xiv the shock make me utter an exclamation
what be the matter
what be the matter she ask in a strange voice
she be look pale and her eye be dim
what be the matter i
why the fact that you be if i be here i have come with all that i have to bring she say
such have always be my way as you shall presently see
please light a i do so whereupon she rise approach the table and lay upon it an open letter
read it she add
it be de griers handwrite i cry as i seize the document
my hand be so tremulous that the line on the page dance before my eye
although at this distance of time i have forget the exact phraseology of the missive i append if not the precise word at all event the general sense
mademoiselle the document run certain untoward circumstance compel me to depart in haste
of course you have of yourself remark that hitherto i have always refrain from have any final explanation with you for the reason that i could not well state the whole circumstance and now to my difficulty the advent of the age grandmother couple with her subsequent proceeding have put the final touch
also the involved state of my affair forbid me to write with any finality concern those hope of ultimate bliss upon which for a long while past i have permit myself to fee
i regret the past but at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never be able to detect anything that be unworthy of a gentleman and a man of honour
have lose however almost the whole of my money in debt incur by your stepfather i find myself drive to the necessity of save the remainder wherefore i have instruct certain friend of mine in petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property which have be mortgage to myself
at the same time know that in addition your frivolous stepfather have squander money which be exclusively yours i have decide to absolve him from a certain moiety of the mortgage on his property in order that you may be in a position to recover of him what you have lose by sue him in legal fashion
i trust therefore that as matter now stand this action of mine may bring you some advantage
i trust also that this same action leave me in the position of have fulfil every obligation which be incumbent upon a man of honour and refinement
rest assure that your memory will for ever remain graven in my all this be clear enough i comment
surely you do not expect aught else from him somehow i be feel annoyed
i expect nothing at all from him she enough to all outward seem yet with a note of irritation in her tone
long ago i make up my mind on the subject for i could read his thought and know what he be think
he think that possibly i should sue one day i might become a here polina halt for a moment and stand bite her lip
so of set purpose i redouble my contemptuous treatment of him and wait to see what he would do
if a telegram to say that we have become legatee have arrive from petersburg i should have fling at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debt and then dismiss him
for a long time i have hat him
even in early day he be not a man and now how gladly i could throw those fifty thousand rouble in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in but the document return the rouble the general get it
if so possess yourself of it and send it to de no no the general have not get just as i expect
well what be the general go to do then an idea suddenly occur to me
what about the grandmother i ask
polina look at me with impatience and bewilderment
what make you speak of be her irritable inquiry
i can not go and live with her
nor she add hotly will i go down upon my knee to why should you i cry
yet to think that you should have love de griers
the villain the villain
but i will kill him in a duel
where be he now in frankfort where he will be stay for the next three well bid me do so and i will go to him by the first train tomorrow i exclaim with enthusiasm
she smile
if you be to do that she say he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand franc
what then would be the use of have a quarrel with him
you talk sheer i ground my teeth
the question i go on be how to raise the fifty thousand franc
we can not expect to find them lie about on the floor
listen
what of astley even as i speak a new and strange idea form itself in my brain
her eye flash fire
what
wish me to leave you for him she cry with a scornful look and a proud smile
never before have she address me thus
then her head must have turn dizzy with emotion for suddenly she seat herself upon the sofa as though she be powerless any long to stand
a flash of lightning seem to strike me as i stand there
i could scarcely believe my eye or my ear
she love me then
it to me and not to astley that she have turn
although she an unprotected girl have come to me in my an hotel have probably compromise herself thereby i have not understood
then a second mad idea flash into my brain
polina i say give me but an hour
wait here just one hour until i return
yes you must do so
do you not see what i mean
just stay here for that and i rush from the room without so much as answer her look of inquiry
she call something after me but i do not return
sometimes it happen that the most insane think the most impossible conception will become so fixed in one s head that at length one believe the thought or the conception to be reality
moreover if with the thought or the conception there be combine a strong a passionate desire one will come to look upon the say thought or conception as something fat inevitable and bound to happen
whether by this there be connoted something in the nature of a combination of presentiment or a great effort of will or a of one s true expectation and so on i do not know but at all event that night saw happen to me a night which i shall never forget something in the nature of the miraculous
although the occurrence can easily be explain by arithmetic i still believe it to have be a miracle
yet why do this conviction take such a hold upon me at the time and remain with me ever since
previously i have think of the idea not as an occurrence which be ever likely to come about but as something which could come about
the time be a quarter past eleven o clock when i enter the casino in such a state of hope though at the same time of agitation as i have never before experienced
in the there be still a large number of people but not half as many as have be present in the morning
at eleven o clock there usually remain behind only the real the desperate for whom at spa there exist nothing beyond roulette and who go thither for that alone
these gamesters take little note of what be go on around them and be interested in none of the appurtenance of the season but play from morning till night and would have be ready to play through the night until dawn have that be possible
as it be they use to disperse unwillingly when at midnight roulette come to an end
likewise as soon as ever roulette be draw to a close and the head croupier have call le trois derniers coups most of them be ready to stake on the last three round all that they have in their for the most part lose it
for my own part i proceed towards the table at which the grandmother have lately sit and since the crowd around it be not very large i soon obtain standing room among the ring of gambler while directly in front of me on the green cloth i saw mark the word passe be a row of number from to inclusive while a row of number from to inclusive be know as but what have that to do with me
i have not have not so much as heard the number upon which the previous coup have fall and so take no bearing when i begin to play as in my place any gambler would have do
no i merely extend my stock of twenty piece and throw them down upon the space passe which happen to be confront me
call the croupier
i have win
i stake upon the same my original stake and my winning
call the croupier
again i have win and be now in possession of eighty piece
next i move the whole eighty on to twelve middle number a stake which if successful would bring me in a triple profit but also involve a risk of two chance to one
the wheel revolve and stop at
upon this i be pay out note and gold until i have by my side a total sum of two thousand gülden
it be as in a fever that i move the pile en bloc on to the red
then suddenly i come to myself though that be the only time during the evening s play when fear cast its cold spell over me and show itself in a trembling of the hand and knee
for with horror i have realise that i win and that upon that stake there depend all my life
rouge call the croupier
i draw a long breath and hot shiver go course over my body
i be pay out my winning in of course to a total of four thousand florin eight hundred gülden i could still calculate the amount
after that i remember i again stake two thousand florin upon twelve middle number and lose
again i stake the whole of my gold with eight hundred gülden in note and lose
then madness seem to come upon me and seize my last two thousand florin i stake them upon twelve of the first by chance and at random and without any sort of reckon
upon my do so there follow a moment of suspense only comparable to that which madame blanchard must have experience when in paris she be descend earthwards from a balloon
quatre call the croupier
once more with the addition of my original stake i be in possession of six thousand florin
once more i look around me like a more i fear nothing as i throw down four thousand of these florin upon the black
the croupier glance around them and exchange a few word the bystander murmur expectantly
the black turn up
after that i do not exactly remember either my calculation or the order of my stakings
i only remember that as in a dream i win in one round sixteen thousand florin that in the three follow round i lose twelve thousand that i move the remainder four thousand on to passe though quite unconscious of what i be be merely wait as it be mechanically and without reflection for something and win and that finally four time in succession i lose
yes i can remember rake in money by most frequently on the twelve middle number to which i constantly adhere and which keep appear in a sort of regular three or four time run and then after an interval of a couple of round in another break of three or four appearance
sometimes this astonishing regularity manifest itself in patch a thing to upset all the calculation of gambler who play with a pencil and a in their hand fortune perpetrate some terrible jest at roulette
since my entry not more than half an hour could have elapse
suddenly a croupier inform me that i have win thirty thousand florin as well as that since the latter be the limit for which at any one time the bank could make itself responsible roulette at that table must close for the night
accordingly i catch up my pile of gold stuffed it into my pocket and grasp my sheaf of move to the table in an adjoining salon where a second game of roulette be in progress
the crowd follow me in a body and clear a place for me at the table after which i proceed to stake as be to say at random and without calculate
what save me from ruin i do not know
of course there be time when fragmentary reckoning come flash into my brain
for instance there be time when i attach myself for a while to certain figure and always leave them again before long without know what i be do
in fact i can not have be in possession of all my faculty for i can remember the croupier correct my play more than once owe to my have make mistake of the grave order
my brow be damp with sweat and my hand be shake
also pole come around me to proffer their service but i heed none of them
nor do my luck fail me now
suddenly there arise around me a loud din of talk and laughter
bravo bravo be the general shout and some people even clap their hand
i have rake in thirty thousand florin and again the bank have have to close for the night
go away now go away now a voice whisper to me on my right
the person who have speak to me be a certain jew of man who have be stand beside me the whole while and occasionally help me in my play
yes for god s sake go whisper a second voice in my left ear
glance around i perceive that the second voice have come from a modestly plainly dressed lady of rather less than woman whose face though pale and bore also very evident trace of former beauty
at the moment i be stuff the crumple into my pocket and collect all the gold that be leave on the table
seize up my last note for five hundred gülden i contrive to insinuate it unperceived into the hand of the pale lady
an overpowering impulse have make me do so and i remember how her thin little finger press mine in token of her lively gratitude
the whole affair be the work of a moment
then collect my belonging i cross to where trente et quarante be be game which could boast of a more aristocratic public and be play with card instead of with a wheel
at this diversion the bank make itself responsible for a hundred thousand thalers as the limit but the high stake allowable be as in roulette four thousand florin
although i know nothing of the i scarcely know the stake except those on black and join the ring of player while the rest of the crowd mass itself around me
at this distance of time i can not remember whether i ever give a thought to polina i seem only to be conscious of a vague pleasure in seize and rake in the which keep mass themselves in a pile before me
but as ever fortune seem to be at my back
as though of set purpose there come to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently repeat itself in game
the circumstance be that not infrequently luck attache itself to say the red and do not leave it for a space of say ten or even fifteen round in succession
three day ago i have hear that during the previous week there have be a run of coup on the occurrence never before know at that men speak of it with astonishment
naturally enough many desert the red after a dozen round and practically no one could now be find to stake upon it
yet upon the black antithesis of the experienced gambler would stake anything for the reason that every practise player know the meaning of capricious that be to say after the sixteenth or so success of the red one would think that the seventeenth coup would inevitably fall upon the black wherefore novice would be apt to back the latter in the seventeenth round and even to double or treble their stake upon in the end to lose
yet some whim or other lead me on remark that the red have come up consecutively for seven time to attach myself to that colour
probably this be mostly due to for i want to astonish the bystander with the riskiness of my play
also i remember strange sensation suddenly and without any challenge from my own presumption become obsess with a to take risk
if the spirit have pass through a great many sensation possibly it can no longer be sate with them but grow more excited and demand more sensation and strong and strong one until at length it fall exhaust
certainly if the rule of the game have permit even of my stake fifty thousand florin at a time i should have stake them
all of a sudden i hear exclamation arise that the whole thing be a marvel since the red be turn up for the fourteenth time
monsieur a gagné cent mille florins a voice exclaim beside me
i awake to my sens
what
i have win a hundred thousand florin
if so what more do i need to win
i grasp the banknote stuff them into my pocket rake in the gold without count it and start to leave the casino
as i pass through the salon people smile to see my bulge pocket and unsteady gait for the weight which i be carry must have amount to half a pood
several hand i saw stretch out in my direction and as i pass i fill them with all the money that i could grasp in my own
at length two jew stop me near the exit
you be a bold young fellow one say but mind you depart early early as you if you do not you will lose everything that you have but i do not heed them
the avenue be so dark that it be barely possible to distinguish one s hand before one s face while the distance to the hotel be half a verst or so but i fear neither pickpocket nor highwayman
indeed never since my boyhood have i do that
also i can not remember what i think about on the way
i only felt a sort of fearful pleasure of success of conquest of power how can i best express it
likewise before me there flit the image of polina and i keep remember and remind myself that it be to i be go that it be in presence i should soon be stand that it be to whom i should soon be able to relate and show everything
scarcely once do i recall what she have lately say to me or the reason why i have leave her or all those varied sensation which i have be experience a bare hour and a half ago
no those sensation seem to be thing of the past to be thing which have right themselves and grown old to be thing concern which we need to trouble ourselves no longer since for us life be about to begin anew
yet i have just reach the end of the avenue when there come upon me a fear of be rob or murder
with each step the fear increase until in my terror i almost start to run
suddenly as i issue from the avenue there burst upon me the light of the hotel sparkle with a myriad lamp
yes thanks be to god i have reach home
run up to my room i fling open the door of it
polina be still on the sofa with a lighted candle in front of her and her hand clasp
as i enter she star at me in astonishment for at the moment i must have present a strange spectacle
all i do however be to halt before her and fling upon the table my burden of wealth
xv i remember too how without move from her place or change her attitude she gaze into my face
i have win two hundred thousand franc cry i as i pull out my last sheaf of
the pile of paper currency occupy the whole table
i could not withdraw my eye from it
consequently for a moment or two polina escape my mind
then i set myself to arrange the pile in order and to sort the note and to mass the gold in a separate heap
that do i leave everything where it lay and proceed to pace the room with rapid stride as i lose myself in thought
then i dart to the table once more and begin to recount the money until all of a sudden as though i have remember something i rush to the door and close and it
finally i come to a meditative halt before my little trunk
shall i put the money there until tomorrow i ask turn sharply round to polina as the recollection of her return to me
she be still in her old making not a sound
yet her eye have follow every one of my movement
somehow in her face there be a strange expression which i do not like
i think that i shall not be wrong if i say that it indicate sheer hatred
impulsively i approach her
polina i say here be thousand thousand franc or more
take them and tomorrow throw them in de griers she return no answer
or if you should prefer i continue let me take them to him myself early tomorrow morning
shall i then all at once she burst out laugh and laugh for a long while
with astonishment and a feeling of offence i gaze at her
her laughter be too like the derisive merriment which she have so often indulge in of which have break forth always at the time of my most passionate explanation
at length she cease and frown at me from under her eyebrow
i be go to take your money she say contemptuously
why not i cry
why not polina because i be not in the habit of receive money for but i be offer it to you as a
in the same way i would offer you my very upon this she throw me a long question glance as though she be seek to probe me to the depth
you be give too much for me she remark with a smile
the beloved of de griers be not worth fifty thousand oh polina how can you speak so i exclaim reproachfully
be de griers you she cry with her eye suddenly flash
why i you
yes yes i you
i love you no more than i do de then she bury her face in her hand and relapse into hysteric
i dart to her side
somehow i have an intuition of something have happen to her which have nothing to do with myself
she be like a person temporarily insane
buy me would you would you
would you buy me for fifty thousand franc as de griers do she gasp between her convulsive sob
i clasp her in my arm kiss her hand and foot and fell upon my knee before her
presently the hysterical fit pass away and lay her hand upon my shoulder she gaze for a while into my face as though try to read i say to her but it be clear that she do not hear it
her face look so dark and despondent that i begin to fear for her reason
at length she draw me towards trustful smile playing over her feature and then as suddenly she push me away again as she eye me dimly
finally she throw herself upon me in an embrace
you love me she say
you who be willing even to quarrel with the baron at my bidding then she as though something dear but laughable have recur to her memory
yes she laugh and weep at the same time
what be i to do
i be like a man in a fever
i remember that she begin to say something to i do not know since she speak with a feverish lisp as though she be try to tell me something very quickly
at interval too she would break off into the smile which i be begin to dread
no no she keep repeat
be my dear one be the man i again she lay her hand upon my shoulder and again she gaze at me as she reiterate you love me you love me
will you love me i could not take my eye off her
never before have i see her in this mood of humility and affection
true the mood be the outcome of hysteria
all of a sudden she notice my ardent gaze and smile slightly
the next moment for no apparent reason she begin to talk of astley
she continue talk and talk about him but i could not make out all she particularly when she be endeavour to tell me of something or other which have happen recently
on the whole she appear to be laugh at astley for she keep repeat that he be wait for her and do i know whether even at that moment he be not stand beneath the window
yes yes he be there she say
open the window and see if he be she push me in that direction yet no sooner do i make a movement to obey her behest than she burst into laughter and i remain beside her and she embrace me
shall we go away tomorrow presently she ask as though some disturb thought have recur to her recollection
how would it be if we be to try and overtake grandmamma
i think we should do so at berlin
and what think you she would have to say to us when we catch her up and her eye first light upon us
what too about astley
would not leap from the shlangenberg for my sake
no
of that i be very sure she laugh
do you know where he be go next year
he say he intend to go to the north pole for scientific investigation and have invite me to go with him
ha ha ha
he also say that we russian know nothing can do nothing without european help
but he be a good fellow all the same
for instance he do not blame the general in the matter but declare that mlle
no i do not know i do not she stop suddenly as though she have say her say and be feel bewilder
what poor creatures these people be
how sorry i be for them and for grandmamma
but when be you go to kill de griers
surely you do not intend actually to murder him
you fool
do you suppose that i should you to fight de griers
nor shall you kill the here she burst out laugh
how absurd you look when you be talk to the burmergelms
i be watch you all the you from where i be sit
and how unwilling you be to go when i send you
oh how i laugh and laugh then she kiss and embrace me again again she press her face to mine with tender passion
yet i neither saw nor hear her for my head be in a whirl
it must have be about seven o clock in the morning when i awake
daylight have come and polina be sit by my strange expression on her face as though she have see a vision and be unable to collect her thought
she too have just awake and be now star at the money on the table
my head ache it felt heavy
i attempt to take polina s hand but she push me from her and leapt from the sofa
the dawn be full of mist for rain have fall yet she move to the window open it and lean her elbow upon the thrust out her head and shoulder to take the air
in this position do she remain for several minute without ever look round at me or listen to what i be say
into my head there come the uneasy thought what be to happen now
how be it all to end
suddenly polina rise from the window approach the table and look at me with an expression of infinite aversion say with lip which quiver with anger well
be you go to hand me over my fifty thousand franc polina you say that again i exclaim
you have change your mind then
ha ha ha
you be sorry you ever promise them on the table where the previous night i have count the money there still be lie the packet of twenty five thousand florin
i hand it to her
the franc be mine then be they
they be mine she inquire viciously as she balance the money in her hand
yes they have be yours i say
then your fifty thousand franc and she hurl them full in my face
the packet burst as she do so and the floor become strew with
the instant that the deed be do she rush from the room
at that moment she can not have be in her right mind yet what be the cause of her temporary aberration i can not say
for a month past she have be unwell
yet what have bring about this condition of mind above all thing this outburst
have it come of wounded pride
have it come of despair over her decision to come to me
have it come of the fact that presume too much on my good fortune i have seem to be intend to desert her even as de griers have do when once i have give her the fifty thousand franc
but on my honour i have never cherish any such intention
what be at fault i think be her own pride which keep urge her not to trust me but rather to insult though she have not realise the fact
in her eye i correspond to de griers and therefore have be condemn for a fault not wholly my own
her mood of late have be a sort of delirium a sort of i know full well yet never have i sufficiently take it into consideration
perhaps she would not pardon me now
ah but this be
what about the future
her delirium and sickness be not likely to make her forget what she have do in bring me de griers letter
no she must have know what she be do when she bring it
somehow i contrive to stuff the pile of note and gold under the bed to cover them over and then to leave the room some ten minute after polina
i felt sure that she have return to her own room wherefore i intend quietly to follow her and to ask the nursemaid aid who open the door how her mistress be
judge therefore of my surprise when meet the domestic on the stair she inform me that polina have not yet return and that she the domestic be at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her
mlle
leave me but ten minute ago i say
what can have become of her the nursemaid look at me reproachfully
already sundry rumour be fly about the hotel
both in the office of the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it be whisper that at seven o clock that morning the fräulein have leave the hotel and set off despite the rain in the direction of the hôtel d angleterre
from word and hint let fall i could see that the fact of polina have spend the night in my room be now public property
also sundry rumour be circulate concern the general s family affair
it be know that last night he have go out of his mind and parade the hotel in tear also that the old lady who have arrive be his mother and that she have come from russia on purpose to forbid her son s marriage with mlle
de cominges as well as to cut him out of her will if he should disobey her also that because he have disobey her she have squander all her money at roulette in order to have nothing more to leave to him
oh these russian exclaim the landlord with an angry toss of the head while the bystander laugh and the clerk betook himself to his account
also every one have learn about my winning karl the corridor lacquey be the first to congratulate me
but with these folk i have nothing to do
my business be to set off at full speed to the hôtel d angleterre
as yet it be early for astley to receive visitor but as soon as he learn that it be who have arrive he come out into the corridor to meet me and stand look at me in silence with his eye as he wait to hear what i have to say
i inquire after polina
she be ill he reply still look at me with his direct unwavering glance
and she be in your yes she be in my then you be mind to keep her there yes i be mind to keep her but astley that will raise a scandal
it ought not to be allow
besides she be very perhaps you have not remark that yes i have
it be i who tell you about it
have she not be ill she would not have go and spend the night with then you know all about it yes for last night she be to have accompany me to the house of a relative of mine
unfortunately be ill she make a mistake and go to your room indeed
then i wish you joy astley
apropos you have remind me of something
be you beneath my window last night
every moment mlle
polina keep tell me to open the window and see if you be there after which she always indeed
no i be not there but i be wait in the corridor and walk about the she ought to see a doctor you know yes she ought
i have send for one and if she die i shall hold you this surprise me
pardon me i reply but what do you mean never mind
tell me if it be true that last night you win two hundred thousand thalers no i win a hundred thousand good heaven
then i suppose you will be off to paris this morning why because all russian who have grow rich go to paris explained astley as though he have read the fact in a book
but what could i do in paris in summer time her astley
surely you know that indeed
i be sure that you do
moreover if you be to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing leave with which to pay your expense in paris
well now
i feel sure that today will see you go from
but i be go to paris
be to become of this family
i mean that the affair of the general and mlle
polina will soon be all over the i daresay yet i hardly suppose that that will break the general s heart
moreover mlle
polina have a perfect right to live where she choose
in short we may say that as a family this family have cease to i depart and find myself smile at the englishman s strange assurance that i should soon be leave for paris
i suppose he mean to shoot me in a duel should polina die
yes that be what he intend to now although i be honestly sorry for polina it be a fact that from the moment when the previous night i have approach the and begin to rake in the packet of my love for her have enter upon a new plane
yes i can say that now although at the time i be barely conscious of it
be i then at heart a gambler
do i after all love polina not so much
no no
as god be my witness i love her
even when i be return home from astley s my suffering be genuine and my sincere
but presently i be to go through an exceedingly strange and ugly experience
i be proceed to the general s room when i hear a door near me open and a voice call me by name
it be s mother the widow de cominges who be invite me in her daughter s name to enter
i do so whereupon i hear a laugh and a little cry proceed from the bedroom the pair occupy a suite of two apartment where mlle
blanche be just arise
ah c est lui
viens donc bête
be it true that you have win a mountain of gold and silver
j aimerais mieux l yes i reply with a smile
how much a hundred thousand bibi comme tu e bête
come in here for i can t hear you where you be now
nous ferons bombance n pas enter her room i find her loll under a pink satin coverlet and reveal a pair of swarthy wonderfully healthy such as one see in cover over with a white cambric nightgown which trim with lace stand out in strike relief against the darkness of her skin
mon fils du cœur she cry when she saw me and then giggle
her laugh have always be a very cheerful one and at time it even sound sincere
tout i begin paraphrase corneille
see here she prattle on
please search for my stocking and help me to dress
aussi si tu n e pa trop bête je te prends à paris

eh bien tu verras paris
dis donc qu que c est qu un utchitel
tu étais bien bête quand tu étais where be my stocking
please help me to and she lift up a really ravish swarthy and not misshapen like the majority of foot which look dainty only in bottines
i laugh and start to draw on to the foot a silk stock while mlle
blanche sit on the edge of the bed and chatter
eh bien que si je te prends avec moi
first of all i must have fifty thousand franc and you shall give them to me at frankfurt
then we will go on to paris where we will live together et je te ferai voir de étoiles en plein jour
yes you shall see such woman as your eye have never light stop a moment
if i be to give you those fifty thousand franc what should i have leave for myself another hundred thousand franc please to remember
besides i could live with you in your room for a month or even for two or even for long
but it would not take us more than two month to get through fifty thousand franc for look you je suis bonne enfante et tu verras de étoiles you may be what
you mean to say that we should spend the whole in two month certainly
do that surprise you very much
ah vil esclave
why one month of that life would be good than all your previous existence
one après le déluge
mais tu ne peux comprendre
va
away away
you be not worth que for while draw on the other stocking i have felt constrain to kiss her
immediately she shrink back kick me in the face with her toe and turn me neck and crop out of the room
eh bien mon utchitel she call after me je t attends si tu veux
i start in a quarter of an hour s i return to my own room with my head in a whirl
it be not my fault that polina have throw a packet in my face and preferred astley to myself
a few be still flutter about the floor and i pick them up
at that moment the door open and the landlord person who until now have never bestow upon me so much as a glance
he have come to know if i would prefer to move to a low a suite which have just be tenant by count for a moment i reflect
no i shout
my account please for in ten minute i shall be to paris to paris i add to myself
every man of birth must make her within a quarter of an hour all three of us be seat in a family
blanche the widow de cominges and myself
mlle
keep laugh hysterically as she look at me and madame her but do not feel so cheerful
my life have break in two and yesterday have infect me with a habit of stake my all upon a card
although it might be that i have fail to win my stake that i have lose my sens that i desire nothing better i felt that the scene be to be change only a
within a month from now i keep think to myself i shall be back again in roulettenberg and i mean to have it out with you astley yes as now i look back at thing i remember that i felt greatly depress despite the absurd gigglings of the egregious blanche
what be the matter with you
how dull you be she cry at length as she interrupt her laughter to take me seriously to task
come come
we be go to spend your two hundred thousand franc for you et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi
i myself will tie your tie for you and introduce you to hortense
and when we have spend your money you shall return here and break the bank again
what do those two jew tell you the thing most need be dare and that you possess it
consequently this be not the first time that you will be hurry to paris with money in your pocket
quant à moi je veux cinquante mille franc de rente et but what about the general i interrupt
the general
you know well enough that at about this hour every day he go to buy me a bouquet
on this occasion i take care to tell him that he must hunt for the choicest of flower and when he return home the poor fellow will find the bird flown
possibly he may take wing in ha ha
and if so i shall not be sorry for he could be useful to me in paris and astley will pay his debt in this manner do i depart for the gay city
xvi of paris what be i to say
the whole proceeding be a delirium a madness
i spend a little over three week there and during that time saw my hundred thousand franc come to an end
i speak only of the hundred thousand franc for the other hundred thousand i give to mlle
blanche in pure cash
that be to say i hand her fifty thousand franc at frankfurt and three day later in paris advance her another fifty thousand on note of hand
nevertheless a week have not elapse ere she come to me for more money
et les cent mille franc qui nous restent she add tu le mangeras avec moi mon yes she always call me her a person more economical grasping and mean than mlle
blanche one could not imagine
but this be only as regard money
hundred thousand franc as she explain to me later she need to set up her establishment in paris so that once and for all i may be on a decent footing and proof against any stone which may be throw at all event for a long time to nevertheless i saw nothing of those hundred thousand franc for my own purse which she inspect daily never manage to amass in it more than a hundred franc at a time and generally the sum do not reach even that figure
what do want with money she would say to me with air of absolute simplicity and i never dispute the point
nevertheless though she fit out her flat very badly with the money the fact do not prevent her from say when later she be show me over the room of her new abode see what care and taste can do with the most wretched of mean however her wretchedness have cost fifty thousand franc while with the remain fifty thousand she purchase a carriage and horse
also we give a couple of party attend by hortense and lisette and cléopatre who be woman remarkable both for the number of their liaison and though only in some case for their good look
at these reunion i have to play the part of meet and entertain fat mercantile parvenu who be impossible by reason of their rudeness and braggadocio colonel of various kind hungry author and journalistic of whom disport themselves in fashionable tailcoat and pale yellow glove and display such an aggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable even in be say a great deal
they use to try to make fun of me but i would console myself by drink champagne and then loll in a
nevertheless i find it deadly work
c est un utchitel blanche would say of me qui a gagné deux cent mille franc and but for me would have have not a notion how to spend them
presently he will have to return to his tutoring
do any one know of a vacant post
you know one must do something for i have the more frequent recourse to champagne in that i constantly felt depressed and bore owe to the fact that i be live in the most bourgeois commercial milieu milieu wherein every sou be count and grudge
indeed two week have not elapse before i perceive that blanche have no real affection for me even though she dress me in elegant clothes and herself tie my tie each day
in short she utterly despise me
but that cause me no concern
blasé and inert i spend my evening generally at the château des fleurs where i would get fuddle and then dance the cancan which in that establishment be a very indecent performance with éclat
at length the time come when blanche have drain my purse dry
she have conceive an idea that during the term of our residence together it would be well if i be always to walk behind her with a paper and pencil in order to jot down exactly what she spend what she have save what she be pay out and what she be lay by
well of course i could not fail to be aware that this would entail a battle over every ten franc so although for every possible objection that i might make she have prepare a suitable answer she soon saw that i make no objection and therefore have to start dispute herself
that be to say she would burst out into tirade which be meet only with silence as i loll on a sofa and star fixedly at the ceiling
this greatly surprise her
at first she imagine that it be due merely to the fact that i be a fool un utchitel wherefore she would break off her harangue in the belief that be too stupid to understand i be a hopeless case
then she would leave the room but return ten minute later to resume the contest
this continue throughout her squandering of my squander altogether out of proportion to our mean
an example be the way in which she change her first pair of horse for a pair which cost sixteen thousand franc
bibi she say on the latter occasion as she approach me surely you be not angry i be merely tire be my reply as i push her from me
this seem to her so curious that straightway she seat herself by my side
you see she go on i decide to spend so much upon these horse only because i can easily sell them again
they would go at any time for thousand yes yes
they be splendid horse and you have get a splendid
i be quite content
let me hear no more of the then you be not angry no
why should i be
you be wise to provide yourself with what you need for it will all come in handy in the future
yes i quite see the necessity of your establish yourself on a good basis for without it you will never earn your million
my hundred thousand franc i look upon merely as a a mere drop in the blanche who have by no mean expect such declaration from me but rather an uproar and protest be rather take aback
well well what a man you be she exclaim
mais tu as l esprit pour comprendre
mon garçon although you be a tutor you ought to have be bear a prince
be you not sorry that your money should be go so quickly no
the quicker it go the dis donc be you rich
mais you have too much contempt for money
qu que tu feras après dis donc après i shall go to homburg and win another hundred thousand oui oui c est ça c est magnifique
ah i know you will win them and bring them to me when you have do so
dis will end by make me love you
since you be what you be i mean to love you all the time and never to be unfaithful to you
you see i have not love you before parce que je croyais que tu n e qu un utchitel quelque choose comme un lacquais n pa
yet all the time i have be true to you parce que je suis bonne you lie i interrupt
do i not see you the other day with that officer oh oh
mais tu yes you be lie right enough
but what make you suppose that i should be angry
rubbish
il faut que jeunesse se passe
even if that officer be here now i should refrain from put him out of the room if i think you really care for him
only mind you do not give him any of my money
you hear you say do you that you would not be angry
mais tu e un vrai philosophe
oui un vrai philosophe
eh bien je t aimerai je t aimerai
tu seras true enough from that time onward she seem to attach herself only to me and in this manner we spend our last ten day together
the promised étoiles i do not see but in other respect she to a certain extent keep her word
moreover she introduce me to hortense who be a remarkable woman in her way and know among us as thérèse philosophe
but i need not enlarge further for to do so would require a story to itself and entail a colouring which i be loth to impart to the present narrative
the point be that with all my faculty i desire the episode to come to an end as speedily as possible
unfortunately our hundred thousand franc last us as i have say for very nearly a greatly surprised me
at all event blanche buy herself article to the tune of eighty thousand franc and the rest suffice just to meet our expense of living
towards the close of the affair blanche grow almost frank with me at least she scarcely lie to me at all amongst other thing that none of the debt which she have be oblige to incur be go to fall upon my head
i have purposely refrain from make you responsible for my bill or borrowing she say for the reason that i be sorry for you
any other woman in my place would have do so and have let you go to prison
see then how much i love you and how i be
think too what this accursed marriage with the general be go to cost me true enough the marriage take place
it do so at the close of our month together and i be bind to suppose that it be upon the ceremony that the last remnant of my money be spend
with it the be to say my sojourn with the to an end and i formally retire from the scene
it happen thus a week after we have take up our abode in paris there arrive thither the general
he come straight to see us and thenceforward live with us practically as our guest though he have a flat of his own as well
blanche meet him with merry badinage and laughter and even throw her arm around him
in fact she manage it so that he have to follow everywhere in her when promenade on the boulevard or when drive or when go to the theatre or when pay call and this use which she make of him quite satisfy the general
still of impose appearance and presence as well as of fair height he have a dye moustache and whisker he have formerly be in the cuirassier and a handsome though a somewhat wrinkled face
also his manner be excellent and he could carry a frockcoat more so since in paris he take to wear his order
to promenade the boulevard with such a man be not only a thing possible but also so to speak a thing advisable and with this programme the good but foolish general have not a fault to find
the truth be that he have never count upon this programme when he come to paris to seek us out
on that occasion he have make his appearance nearly shake with terror for he have suppose that blanche would at once raise an outcry and have him put from the door wherefore he be the more enraptured at the turn that thing have take and spend the month in a state of senseless ecstasy
already i have learnt that after our unexpected departure from roulettenberg he have have a sort of a he have fall into a swoon and spend a week in a specie of garrulous delirium
doctor have be summon to him but he have break away from them and suddenly take a train to paris
of course blanche s reception of him have act as the best of all possible cure but for long enough he carry the mark of his affliction despite his present condition of rapture and delight
to think clearly or even to engage in any serious conversation have now become impossible for him he could only ejaculate after each word hm and then nod his head in confirmation
sometimes also he would laugh but only in a nervous hysterical sort of a fashion while at other time he would sit for hour look as black as night with his heavy eyebrow knit
of much that go on he remain wholly oblivious for he grow extremely and take to talk to himself
only blanche could awake him to any semblance of life
his fit of depression and moodiness in corner always mean either that he have not see her for some while or that she have go out without take him with her or that she have omit to caress him before depart
when in this condition he would refuse to say what he have he the least idea that he be thus sulk and mop
next after remain in this condition for an hour or two this i remark on two occasion when blanche have go out for the to see albert he would begin to look about him and to grow uneasy and to hurry about with an air as though he have suddenly remember something and must try and find it after which not perceive the object of his search nor succeeding in recall what that object have be he would as suddenly relapse into oblivion and continue so until the reappearance of wanton and laugh her strident laugh as she approach to pet him and even to kiss him though the latter reward he seldom receive
once he be so overjoyed at her do so that he burst into tear
even i myself be surprised
from the first moment of his arrival in paris blanche set herself to plead with me on his behalf and at such time she even rise to height of that it be for she have abandon him though she have almost become his betrothed and promise to become so that it be for sake he have desert his family that have be in his service i ought to remember the fact and to feel ashamed
to all this i would say nothing however much she chatter on until at length i would burst out laughing and the incident would come to an end at first as i have say she have think me a fool but since she have come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility
in short i have the happiness of call her good nature into play for though at first i have not deem her so she be in reality a woman after her own fashion
you be good and clever she say to me towards the finish and my one regret be that you be also so
you will be a rich man un vrai kalmuk she usually call me
several time she send me to give the general an airing in the street even as she might have do with a lacquey and her spaniel but i prefer to take him to the theatre to the bal mabille and to restaurant
for this purpose she usually allow me some money though the general have a little of his own and enjoy take out his purse before stranger
once i have to use actual force to prevent him from buy a phaeton at a price of seven hundred franc after a vehicle have catch his fancy in the palais royal as seem to be a desirable present for blanche
what could have do with a phaeton the general possess in the world but a thousand franc
the origin even of those franc i could never determine but imagine them to have emanate from more so since the latter have pay the family s hotel bill
as for what view the general take of myself i think that he never divine the footing on which i stand with blanche
true he have hear in a dim sort of way that i have win a good deal of money but more probably he suppose me to be act as even as a kind of his inamorata
at all event he continue to address me in his old haughty style as my superior
at time he even take it upon himself to scold me
one morning in particular he start to sneer at me over our matutinal coffee
though not a man prone to take offence he suddenly and for some reason of which to this day i be ignorant fell out with me
of course even he himself do not know the reason
to put thing shortly he begin a speech which have neither begin nor end and cry out à bâtons rompus that i be a boy whom he would soon put to so forth and so forth
yet no one could understand what he be say and at length blanche explode in a burst of laughter
finally something appease him and he be take out for his walk
more than once however i notice that his depression be grow upon him that he seem to be feel the want of somebody or something that despite blanche s presence he be miss some person in particular
twice on these occasion do he plunge into a conversation with me though he could not make himself intelligible and only go on ramble about the service his late wife his home and his property
every now and then also some particular word would please him whereupon he would repeat it a hundred time in the though the word happen to express neither his thought nor his feeling
again i would try to get him to talk about his child but always he cut me short in his old snappish way and pass to another subject
yes child be all that i could extract from him
yes you be right in what you have say about only once do he disclose his real feeling
that be when we be take him to the theatre and suddenly he exclaim my unfortunate child
yes sir they unfortunate once too when i chance to mention polina he grow quite bitter against her
she be an ungrateful woman he exclaim
she be a bad and ungrateful woman
she have break up a family
if there be law here i would have her impaled
yes i as for de griers the general would not have his name mention
he have ruin me he would say
he have rob me and cut my throat
for two year he be a perfect nightmare to me
for month at a time he never leave me in my dream
do not speak of him it be now clear to me that blanche and he be on the point of come to term yet true to my usual custom i say nothing
at length blanche take the initiative in explain matter
she do so a week before we part
il a de la chance she prattle for the grandmother be now ill and therefore bound to die
astley have just send a telegram to say so and you will agree with me that the general be likely to be her heir
even if he should not be so he will not come amiss since in the first place he have his pension and in the second place he will be content to live in a back room whereas shall be madame general and get into a good circle of society she be always think of this and become a russian châtelaine
yes i shall have a mansion of my own and peasant and a million of money at my but suppose he should prove jealous
he might demand all sort of thing you know
do you follow me oh dear no
how ridiculous that would be of him
besides i have take measure to prevent it
you need not be alarm
that be to say i have induce him to sign note of hand in albert s name
consequently at any time i could get him punish
isn t he ridiculous very well then
marry and in truth she do the marriage be a family one only and involve no pomp or ceremony
in fact she invite to the nuptials none but albert and a few other friend
hortense cléopatre and the rest she keep firmly at a distance
as for the bridegroom he take a great interest in his new position
blanche herself tie his tie and blanche herself pomade the result that in his frockcoat and white waistcoat he look quite comme il faut
il est pourtant comme il faut blanche remark when she issue from his room as though the idea that he be comme il faut have impressed even her
for myself i have so little knowledge of the minor detail of the affair and take part in it so much as a supine spectator that i have forget most of what pass on this occasion
i only remember that blanche and the widow figure at it not as de cominges but as du why they have hitherto be de cominges i do not only know that this entirely satisfy the general that he like the name du placet even good than he have like the name de on the morning of the wedding he pace the salon in his gala attire and keep repeat to himself with an air of great gravity and importance mlle
blanche du placet
mlle
blanche du placet du placet he beam with satisfaction as he do so
both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remain not only pleased and content but even proud
she too underwent a change for now she assume an air of added dignity
i must behave altogether differently she confide to me with a serious air
yet mark you there be a tiresome circumstance of which i have never before be how best to pronounce my new family name
zagorianski zagozianski madame la générale de sago madame la générale de fourteen these infernal russian name
the of them would be the best to use don t you think at length the time have come for us to part and blanche the egregious blanche shed real tear as she take her leave of me
tu étais bon enfant she say with a sob
je te croyais bête et tu en avais l air but it suit then have give me a final handshake she exclaim attends whereafter run into her boudoir she bring me thence two note
i could scarcely believe my eye
they may come in handy for you she explain for though you be a very learned tutor you be a very stupid man
more than two thousand franc however i be not go to give you for the reason that if i do so you would gamble them all away
now
nous serons toujours bons amis and if you win again do not fail to come to me et tu seras i myself have still five hundred franc leave as well as a watch worth a thousand franc a few diamond stud and so on
consequently i could subsist for quite a length of time without particularly bestir myself
purposely i have take up my abode where i be now partly to pull myself together and partly to wait for astley who i have learn will soon be here for a day or so on business
yes i know that and then i shall go to homburg
but to roulettenberg i shall not go until next year for they say it be bad to try one s luck twice in succession at a table
moreover homburg be where the best play be carry on
xvii it be a year and eight month since i last look at these note of mine
i do so now only because be overwhelm with depression i wish to distract my mind by read them through at random
i leave them off at the point where i be just go to homburg
my god with what a light heart comparatively speak do i write the concluding line it may be not so much with a light heart as with a measure of and unquenchable hope
at that time have i any doubt of myself
yet behold me now
scarcely a year and a half have pass yet i be in a bad position than the mean beggar
but what be a beggar
a fig for beggary
i have ruin be all
nor be there anything with which i can compare myself there be no moral which it would be of any use for you to read to me
at the present moment nothing could well be more incongruous than a moral
oh you person who in your unctuous pride be forever ready to mouth your only you know how fully i myself comprehend the sordidness of my present state you would not trouble to wag your tongue at me
what could you say to me that i do not already know
well wherein lie my difficulty
it lie in the fact that by a single turn of a roulette wheel everything for me have become change
yet have thing befall otherwise these moralist would have be among the first yes i feel persuade of it to approach me with friendly jest and congratulation
yes they would never have turn from me as they be do now
a fig for all of them
what be i
i be
what shall i be tomorrow
i may be rise from the dead and have begin life anew
for still i may discover the man in myself if only my manhood have not become utterly shattered
i go i say to homburg but afterwards go also to roulettenberg as well as to spa and baden in which latter place for a time i act as valet to a certain rascal of a privy councillor by name heintze who until lately be also my master here
yes for five month i live my life with lacqueys
that be just after i have come out of roulettenberg prison where i have lie for a small debt which i owe
out of that prison i be bail whom
by astley
by polina
i do not know
at all event the debt be pay to the tune of two hundred thalers and i sallied forth a free man
but what be i to do with myself
in my dilemma i have recourse to this heintze who be a young scapegrace and the sort of man who could speak and write three language
at first i act as his secretary at a salary of thirty gülden a month but afterwards i become his lacquey for the reason that he could not afford to keep a an unpaid servant
i have nothing else to turn to so i remain with him and allow myself to become his flunkey
but by stint myself in meat and drink i save during my five month of service some seventy gülden and one evening when we be at baden i tell him that i wish to resign my post and then hasten to betake myself to roulette
oh how my heart beat as i do so
no it be not the money that i i want be to make all this mob of heintzes hotel proprietor and fine lady of baden talk about me recount my story wonder at me extol my doings and worship my winning
true these be childish fancy and aspiration but who know but that i might meet polina and be able to tell her everything and see her look of surprise at the fact that i have overcome so many adverse stroke of fortune
no i have no desire for money for its own sake for i be perfectly well aware that i should only squander it upon some new blanche and spend another three week in paris after buy a pair of horse which have cost sixteen thousand franc
no i never believe myself to be a hoarder in fact i know only too well that i be a spendthrift
and already with a sort of fear a sort of sinking in my heart i could hear the cry of the trente et un rouge impair et passe quarte noir pair et how greedily i gaze upon the with its scattered louis d or piece and thalers upon the stream of gold as they issue from the croupier s hand and pile themselves up into heap of gold scintillating as fire upon the roll of silver lie around the croupier
even at a distance of two room i could hear the chink of that much so that i nearly fell into convulsion
ah the evening when i take those seventy gülden to the gaming table be a memorable one for me
i begin by stake ten gülden upon passe
for passe i have always have a sort of predilection yet i lose my stake upon it
this leave me with sixty gülden in silver
after a moment s think i select by stake five gülden at a time
twice i lose but the third round suddenly bring up the desire coup
i could almost have die with joy as i receive my one hundred and gülden
indeed i have be less pleased when in former time i have win a hundred thousand gülden
lose no time i stake another hundred gülden upon the red and win two hundred upon the red and win four hundred upon the black and win eight hundred upon manque and win
thus with the addition of the remainder of my original capital i find myself possess within five minute of seventeen hundred gülden
ah at such moment one forget both oneself and one s former failure
this i have gain by risk my very life
i have dare so to risk and behold again i be a member of mankind
i go and hire a room i shut myself up in it and sit count my money until three o clock in the morning
to think that when i awake on the morrow i be no lacquey
i decide to leave at once for homburg
there i should neither have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison
half an hour before start i go and venture a couple of more with the result that in all i lose fifteen hundred florin
nevertheless i proceed to homburg and have now be there for a month
of course i be live in constant trepidation playing for the small of stake and always look out for stand whole day by the to watch the seeing that play in my seem the while to be in some way stiffen to be grow cake as it be in mire
but i must conclude my note which i finish under the impression of a recent encounter with astley
i have not see him since we part at roulettenberg and now we meet quite by accident
at the time i be walk in the public garden and meditate upon the fact that not only have i still some fifty gülden in my possession but also i have fully pay up my hotel bill three day ago
consequently i be in a position to try my luck again at roulette and if i win anything i should be able to continue my play whereas if i lose what i now possess i should once more have to accept a lacquey s place provide that in the alternative i fail to discover a russian family which stand in need of a tutor
plunge in these reflection i start on my daily walk through the park and forest towards a neighbouring principality
sometimes on such occasion i spend four hour on the way and would return to homburg tired and hungry but on this particular occasion i have scarcely leave the garden for the park when i catch sight of astley seat on a bench
as soon as he perceive me he call me by name and i go and sit down beside him but on noticing that he seem a little stiff in his manner i hasten to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him have call forth
here he say
well i have an idea that i should meet you
do not trouble to tell me anything for i know all
in fact your whole life during the past twenty month lie within my how closely you watch the doings of your old friend i reply
that do you infinite credit
but stop a moment
you have remind me of something
be it you who bail me out of roulettenberg prison when i be lie there for a debt of two hundred gülden
do oh dear no i know all the time that you be lie perhaps you could tell me who bail me out no i be afraid i could what a strange thing
for i know no russian at all here so it can not have be a russian who befriend me
in russia we orthodox folk go bail for one another but in this case i think it must have be do by some english stranger who be not conversant with the way of the astley seem to listen to me with a sort of surprise
evidently he have expect to see me look more crushed and broken than i be
well he very pleasantly i be none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your which mean that you be vex at not have find me more abased and humiliate than i be i retort with a smile
astley be not quick to understand this but presently do so and laugh
your remark please me as they always do he continue
in those word i see the clever triumphant and above all thing cynical friend of former day
only russian have the faculty of combine within themselves so many opposite quality
yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it be on such abasement that friendship be found
all think person know that ancient truth
yet on the present occasion i assure you i be sincerely glad to see that you be cast down
tell me be you never go to give up gamble damn the gambling
yes i should certainly have give it up be it not that you be lose
i think so
you need not tell me any more
i know how thing stand for you have say that last in despair and therefore truthfully
have you no other employment than gamble no none astley give me a search glance
at that time it be age since i have last look at a paper or turn the page of a book
you be grow blasé he say
you have not only renounced life with its interest and social tie but the duty of a citizen and a man you have not only renounce the friend whom i know you to have have and every aim in life but that of win money but you have also renounce your memory
though i can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life i feel persuade that you have now forget every good feeling of that your present dream and aspiration of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle number and so enough astley i cry with some in anger
kindly do not recall to me any more recollection for i can remember thing for myself
only for a time have i put them out of my head
only until i shall have rehabilitate myself be i keep my memory dull
when that hour shall come you will see me arise from the then you will have to be here another ten year he reply
should i then be alive i will remind on this very what i have just say
in fact i will bet you a wager that i shall do say no more i interrupt impatiently
and to show you that i have not wholly forget the past may i enquire where mlle
polina be
if it be not you who bail me out of prison it must have be she
yet never have i hear a word concern no i do not think it be she
at the present moment she be in switzerland and you will do me a favour by cease to ask me these question about astley say this with a firm and even an angry air
which mean that she have deal you a serious wound i burst out with an involuntary sneer
mlle
polina he continue be the best of all possible living being but i repeat that i shall thank you to cease question me about her
you never really know her and her name on your lip be an offence to my moral indeed
on what subject then have i a good right to speak to you than on this
with it be bind up all your recollection and mine
however do not be alarm i have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affair
my interest in mlle
polina do not extend beyond her outward circumstance and surroundings
about them you could tell me in two well on condition that the matter shall end there i will tell you that for a long time mlle
polina be ill and still be so
my mother and sister entertain her for a while at their home in the north of england and thereafter mlle
polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman
die and leave mlle
polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pound sterling
that be about six month ago and now mlle
be travel with my sister s sister have since marry
s little brother and sister also benefit by the grandmother s will and be now be educate in london
as for the general he die in paris last month of a stroke
mlle
blanche do well by him for she succeed in have transfer to herself all that he receive from the grandmother
that i think concludes all that i have to and de griers
be he too travel in switzerland no nor do i know where he be
also i warn you once more that you have good avoid such hint and ignoble supposition otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with what
in spite of our old friendship yes in spite of our old then i beg your pardon a thousand time astley
i mean nothing offensive to mlle
polina for i have nothing of which to accuse her
moreover the question of there be anything between this frenchman and this russian lady be not one which you and i need discus nor even attempt to if reply astley you do not care to hear their name couple together may i ask you what you mean by the expression this frenchman this russian lady and there be anything between them
why do you call them so particularly a frenchman and a russian lady ah i see you be interested astley
but it be a long long story and call for a lengthy preface
at the same time the question be an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance
a frenchman astley be merely a fine figure of a man
with this you as a britisher may not agree
with it i also as a russian may not of envy
yet possibly our good lady be of another opinion
for instance one may look upon racine as a hobbledehoy perfumed may even be unable to read him and i too may think him the same as well as in some respect a subject for ridicule
yet about him astley there be a certain charm and above all thing he be a great one might like to deny it
yes the frenchman the parisian as a national figure be in process of develop into a figure of elegance before we russians have even cease to be bear
the revolution bequeath to the french nobility its heritage and now every of a parisian may possess manner method of expression and even thought that be above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in manner and the rest have come to him through inheritance
yes take by himself the frenchman be frequently a fool of fool and a villain of villain
per contra there be no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young russian lady
de griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he have an imposing figure astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real the natural form of his heart and of the mere cloak with which heredity have dower him
and even though it may offend you i feel bound to say that the majority also of english people be uncouth and unrefined whereas we russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and be always eager to cultivate the same
but to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there be need far more independence and freedom than be possess by our woman especially by our young lady
at all event they need more
for instance this mlle
me but the name have pass my lip and i can not well recall take a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to monsieur de griers
she may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reign that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer de griers
this will be due to obstinacy and the fact that de griers once appear to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who be do his best to help her family and the frivolous old general and although these transaction of his have since be expose you will find that the exposure have make no impression upon her mind
only give her the de griers of former day and she will ask of you no more
the more she may detest the present de griers the more will she lament the de griers of the though the latter never exist but in her own imagination
you be a sugar refiner astley be you not yes i belong to the firm of lovell and then see here
on the one hand you be a sugar refiner while on the other hand you be an apollo belvedere
but the two character do not mix with one another
i again be not even a sugar refiner i be a mere roulette gambler who have also serve as a lacquey
of this fact mlle
polina be probably well aware since she appear to have an excellent force of police at her you be say this because you be feel bitter say astley with cold indifference
yet there be not the least originality in your i agree
but therein lie the horror of it how trepidation play ever mean and farcical my accusation may be they be none the le
but i be only waste yes you be for you be only talk nonsense exclaim my voice now tremble and his eye flash fire
be you aware he continue that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you be it be at request i come to homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feeling and thought and and your recollection of her too indeed
be that really so i tear begin to well from my eye
never before have this happen
yes poor unfortunate continue astley
she love you and i may tell you this now for the reason that now you be utterly lose
even if i be also to tell you that she still love you you would none the less have to remain where you be
yes you have ruin yourself beyond redemption
once upon a time you have a certain amount of talent and you be of a lively disposition and your good look be not to be despise
you might even have be useful to your country which need men like you
yet you remain here and your life be now over
i be not blame you for my view all russian resemble you or be incline to do so
if it be not roulette then it be something else
the exception be very rare
nor be you the first to learn what a taskmaster be yours
for roulette be not exclusively a russian game
hitherto you have honourably prefer to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you i tremble to think
now
you be in want of money i suppose
then take these ten louis d or
more i shall not give you for you would only gamble it away
take care of these coin and farewell
once more of no astley
after all that have be say of them repeat my friend
i be certain you be still a gentleman and therefore i give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another
also if i could be certain that you would leave both homburg and the and return to your own country i would give you a thousand pound down to start life afresh but i give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pound for the reason that at the present time a thousand pound and ten louis d or will be all the same to will lose the one as readily as you will the other
take the money therefore and yes i take it if at the same time you will embrace with so we term of sincere affection
but he be wrong
if be hard and undiscerning as regard polina and de griers be hard and undiscerning as regard russian people generally
of myself i say nothing
word be only word
i need to
above all thing i need to think of switzerland
tomorrow but if only i could set thing right tomorrow and be bear again and rise again from the dead
but can not
yet i must show her what i can do
even if she should do no more than learn that i can still play the man it would be worth it
today it be too late but
yet i have a presentiment that thing can never be otherwise
i have get fifteen louis d or in my possession although i begin with fifteen gülden
if i be to play carefully at the no no
surely i be not such a fool as that
yet should i not rise from the dead
i should require at first but to go cautiously and patiently and the rest would follow
i should require but to put a check upon my nature for one hour and my fortune would be change entirely
yes my nature be my weak point
i have only to remember what happen to me some month ago at roulettenberg before my final ruin
what a notable instance that be of my capacity for resolution
on the occasion in question i have lose yet just as i be leave the casino i hear another gülden give a rattle in my pocket
perhaps i shall need it for a meal i think to myself but a hundred pace further on i change my mind and return
that gülden i stake upon there something in the feeling that though one be alone and in a foreign land and far from one s own home and friend and ignorant of whence one s next meal be to come one be nevertheless stake one s very last coin
well i win the stake and in twenty minute have leave the casino with a hundred and seventy gülden in my pocket
that be a fact and it show what a last remaining gülden can do
but what if my heart have fail me or i have shrunk from make up my mind
no tomorrow all shall be end
