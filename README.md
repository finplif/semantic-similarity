## This class combines various methods to linguistically analyze and play with text. I use gensim, a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora.

## My class allows to:
### • lemmatize text
### • train model in accordance with set parameters
### • get all the words used in a text in an alphabetical order
### • get n most similar words for one chosen
### • get semantic proportion for a chosen word
### • in a list of words find an odd one
### • visualize words similarity 
### • swap each word in a sentence with the most similar one

## gambler.txt – original text
## new-text.txt – original text lemmatized and cleaned from punctuation with each sentence on a new line
